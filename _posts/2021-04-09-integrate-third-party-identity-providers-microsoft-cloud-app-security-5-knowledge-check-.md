####  1. An administrator at Contoso wants to use device identification as a way to enforce Conditional App Access Control in Cloud App Security. The administrator knows that client certificates in a trusted chain can be used to make a determination around access or session policies that implement device state as a filter. Which of the following can also be used?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whether a device is AD DS joined.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whether a device is Azure AD joined.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whether a device is Azure AD registered.
<br />

####  2. An administrator at Contoso wants to use device identification as a way to enforce Conditional App Access Control in Cloud App Security. The administrator knows that client certificates in a trusted chain can be used to make a determination around access or session policies that implement device state as a filter. The administrator starts to upload root CA certificates to the Cloud App Security portal. What format do the certificates need to be?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Certificates must be in the .CER format.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Certificates must be in the PEM format.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Certificates must be in the P7B format.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. When an administrator starts to deploy Conditional Access App Control with AD FS as the identity provider, they create a new AD FS Relying Party Trust and App Single Sign-On configuration. Why is this necessary?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To duplicate the existing configuration.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To create a secondary configuration, which is a requirement of this process.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To limit end-user downtime and preserve your existing known good configuration.
