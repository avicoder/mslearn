####  1. Why would you use a custom route in a virtual network?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To load balance the traffic within your virtual network.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To connect to your Azure virtual machines using RDP or SSH.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To control the flow of traffic within your Azure virtual network.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To connect to resources in another virtual network hosted in Azure.

####  2. Why might you use virtual network peering?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To connect virtual networks together in the same region or across regions.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To assign public IP addresses to all of your resources across multiple virtual networks.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;So that load balancers can control traffic flow across your virtual networks.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To run custom reports that scan and identify what resources are running across all of your virtual networks, as opposed to running reports on each virtual network.
