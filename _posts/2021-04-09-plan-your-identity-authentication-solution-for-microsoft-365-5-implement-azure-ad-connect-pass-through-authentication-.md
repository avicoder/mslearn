####  1. As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, you're planning its Microsoft 365 deployment. You're currently investigating authentication strategies. While you're interested in Azure AD Connect Pass-through authentication, you're concerned whether Contoso's environment can support it. If you implement pass-through authentication, which of the following scenarios will it support?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Users sign in to Outlook clients using legacy protocols such as Exchange ActiveSync, SMTP, POP, and IMAP

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Users sign in to Skype for Business client applications without modern authentication

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Access to calendar sharing and free/busy information in Exchange hybrid environments on Office 2010 only
