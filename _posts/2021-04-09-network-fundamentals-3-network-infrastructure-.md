####  1. What are network standards used for?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that hardware conforms to a minimum standard necessary for a good network development.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that software is tightly constrained and meets the needs of the organization's network.

####  2. What is the primary purpose of a hub?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A hub allows one Ethernet network device to send data packets to a specific Ethernet device.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A hub allows the connection of multiple Ethernet devices to make them act as a single network segment.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A hub allows multiple Ethernet network devices access to the internet.

####  3. What is the principal difference between hub routing and switch routing?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Hub routing sends all packets to all connected devices. Switch routing sends packets to specific devices.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Hub routing sends packets to specific locations. Switch routing is only used to route traffic between switches.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Hub routing sends all packets to all connected devices. Switch routing is only used to route traffic between switches.

####  4. What does a router do?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A router is a network device that works out the fastest and most efficient way to send data across a network.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A router is a network device that forwards data packets around faults in your network.
