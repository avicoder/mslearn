####  1. The marketing department for an organization has provided guidelines for the email templates that they want to use in Dynamics 365 Customer Voice. They have provided the body of the email, a few images, and the company logo. The survey link and unsubscribe link are required and can be added by the person who is setting up the templates, but one other item is needed before they can be created. Which of the following options is required and must also be included on the email templates?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The email subject

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The respondents whom the email should be sent to

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The variables that are needed in the survey
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. The events team has a CSV file with over 250 names of people who attended a recent event. The file contains email addresses, full names, phone numbers, and account names. After reviewing the file, the survey maker realizes that some changes must be made before it can be imported to send the survey. What changes need to be made?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Phone number and account name don’t exist as variables, so they must be added to the survey first.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Phone number and account must be deleted, and the full name must be split into First Name and Last Name variables.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Phone number and account must be deleted for the file to import successfully.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. An organization is conducting a survey to gather feedback on the general public’s views on working remotely. The survey has been created and is ready to share. The organization wants to get as many responses as possible and wants to get feedback that they can use for their own internal analysis. What would be the best way to share the survey?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the direct link or QR code to share on social media in a series of posts that can be viewed by their customers, employees, and the wider general public.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use Power Automate to send the survey through emails or text messages to all customers in their Dataverse environment.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Send an email functionality from Dynamics 365 Customer Voice to send the survey to all contacts in a Dynamics 365 view.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. The support manager at an organization wants to have a survey embedded on the company website, which would provide a way for customers to ask questions and raise issues without needing to sign in to a portal. A new survey is created and is ready to be added to the site. What are the three available options that the manager will have when generating the survey code?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Inline, pop-up, and dynamic

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Button, inline, and formatted

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pop-up, button, and inline
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  5. An organization has created a survey to send out to a customer when a project is complete. The internal customer services manager wants to gather feedback on how the customer feels about the success of the project. Some variables have been added to the survey to populate the project number, project name, and project manager who is associated with the project. How can this information be passed through to the survey so that the customer receives a personalized experience?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add the variables to the survey and then use Power Automate to create a flow and pass dynamic values to the variables.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add the variables to the survey and then share the direct link with the customer so that they can complete the survey.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add the variables to the survey and then send an email to the customer directly from Dynamics 365 Customer Voice.
