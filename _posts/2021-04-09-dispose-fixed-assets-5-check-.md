####  1. CRONUS purchases a new truck for LCY 125,000.00. They estimate that after the depreciable lifetime, which is five years, the truck will still have a value of around LCY 22,000.00. They want to consider this value by decreasing the periodic depreciations, starting from the first period. How can they achieve this objective?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;In the purchase invoice that they use to post the acquisition cost, they should enter 22,000.00 in the Ending Value field.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When creating the fixed asset, they should enter 22,000.00 in the Ending Book Value field on the Posting FastTab.

####  2. You have an asset that you want to dispose of; however, because it is damaged, you can't sell it. How can you process the disposal?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Select the Inactive check box on the fixed asset card.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Post the disposal from a fixed asset G/L journal or a fixed asset journal.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer the fixed asset to a location that is set up for obsolete assets.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Post a write-down of 100 percent to the asset.
