####  1. How would you describe a function code?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A function code is set of interdependent functions that can be executed on the server.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A function code is the main content that executes and performs some jobs without any dependency on the server.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A function code is merely code deployed in the local environment to perform a job.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Suppose that you’re task with deploying a cognitive speech API into your function app. In what order would you perform the following steps to create a speech translation app?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Trigger the function - speech recognition - removing speech disfluencies – translation – text-to-speech

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Trigger the function - removing speech disfluencies – translation – text-to-speech

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Speech recognition - removing speech disfluencies – translation - text-to-speech
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Suppose you want to develop an application using the Cognitive service API in the Azure function. How do you access the Cognitive Service API from your application?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You could directly access the Cognitive Service api within Azure function once it establishes the connection.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You'll need to generate an API key each time to make an attempt to connect and access the cognitive service API.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You create a Cognitive service account that will generate an API key that can be used to access to service API
