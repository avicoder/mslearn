####  1. You're the Enterprise Administrator for Tailwind Traders, which up until last month was located in Paris, France. When Tailwind purchased its Microsoft 365 subscription two years ago, its Organization Profile listed the country/region in which the company is headquartered as France. However, Tailwind recently moved its corporate headquarters to New York. To change the company's headquarters for its Microsoft 365 subscription to the United States, what must you do?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to access Tailwind's Organization Profile and change the country/region of the company's headquarters to the United States

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Contact Microsoft Support Services and have them update the country/region of your Microsoft 365 subscription to the United States

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sign up for a new account, choose the United States as the desired country/region, and purchase a new subscription
