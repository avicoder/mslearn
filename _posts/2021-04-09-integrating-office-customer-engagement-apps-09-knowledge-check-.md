####  1. You are wanting to work with files from SharePoint from within Dynamics 365. Where can you access SharePoint files from in the Dynamics 365 Interface?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From the command menu.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;SharePoint Tab on a form.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Documents Tab on a form.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From the main menu.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You have setup the integration between Dynamics 365 and Groups. People with the Sales role have full access to all the functionality offered in Groups from within Dynamics 365. For some reason people that have the customer service role are having problems. What should you check?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Check that the Customer Service role has Modify Customizations constraints privilege.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Check that the Customer Service role has Activate Real-time Processes privilege.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Check that the Customer Service role has Web Resources privilege.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Check that the Customer Service role has ISV Extensions privilege.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Unlike Word templates, which are generated from a specific record, Excel templates are only generated from __________. Fill in the blank.


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Tabs.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Views.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sections.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Forms.
