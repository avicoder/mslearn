####  1. Which of the following statements is about the connection to the intelligent cloud is true?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Before setting up the connection to the intelligent cloud, you must ensure that at least one user in the system has SUPER permissions. This is the only user that will be allowed to make changes in the Business Central tenant.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Data in the cloud will not be overwritten by the intelligent cloud solution.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Users in the intelligent cloud user group will be able to make changes to the Business Central tenant.

####  2. Is it possible to view intelligent cloud insights in your Business Central on-premises environment?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, it is only possible to view intelligent cloud insights in your Business Central cloud tenant.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When your Dynamics 365 reselling partner has acquired the right license for your on-premises solution to connect to the cloud through Business Central, your administrator can set up the connection. Once that is done, you can view the same insights from the cloud in your on-premises application.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;After your administrator has set up the connection, you can view some, but not all, insights from the cloud in your on-premises application.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;After your administrator has set up the connection, you can open a support ticket at Microsoft so they can set up the connection. Once that is done, you can view the same insights from the cloud in your on-premises application.
