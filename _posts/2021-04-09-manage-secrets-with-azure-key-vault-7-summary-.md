<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Azure Key Vault client library protects regions of memory used by your application to prevent accidental secret exposure.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Azure Key Vault double-encrypts secrets, requiring your app to decrypt them locally every time they're used.
