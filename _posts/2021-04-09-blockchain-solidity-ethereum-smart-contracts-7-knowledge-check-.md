####  1. What are smart contracts?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Programs that only send cryptocurrency.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Programs that only generate and send tokens.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Programs that are stored inside a blockchain. They represent an agreement between parties that are sending digital assets.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Programs that are stored outside a blockchain. They must be signed by parties that are sending digital assets.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. When a new project is created by using the Blockchain development kit for Ethereum, what gets automatically generated?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A sample contract file written in Solidity

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A build folder and files to compile and deploy the Solidity project

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Folders for contracts, migrations, and tests.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sample contract, migrations, a test, and a Truffle config file.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. What is Truffle?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A command-line tool that you can use to create smart contracts

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A personal blockchain Ethereum development tool that you can use to deploy contracts

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A library that you can use to write blockchain applications
