####  1. The cash flow forecast chart predicts a negative cash flow in three weeks. You’re planning a short-term loan to cover the negative cash flow, and you want to simulate this by entering a cash flow manual revenue. How can you accomplish this task?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;For the loan, enter a general journal line that you don’t post. In the cash flow forecast, select the Include Unposted General Journals field and then enter the journal template and journal batch name.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Search icon to search for cash flow forecasts and then select the cash flow forecast for which you want to enter the manual revenue. Next, in the ribbon, select Cash Flow Manual Revenues and enter a new line for the short-term loan.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enter a new general ledger budget entry for an income statement account and select the Cash Flow Manual Revenue field.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Select the ellipsis options icon (…) of the cash flow forecast chart in your role center and then select Edit Manual Revenues. You can then enter a new line for the short-term loan.
