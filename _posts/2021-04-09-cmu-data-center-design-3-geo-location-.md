####  1. Company X has a datacenter in Houston, Texas, and pays a power bill of $1,700,000 in power costs annually. The company is planning to relocate to an identical facility in Vancouver, Canada. The move allows the company to utilize air-side economization from the beginning of October through the end of March. The company's chiller consumes 25% of the total power drawn by the datacenter and can be turned off during air-side economization. Assuming all other costs are identical, how much money can company X save annually when it relocates to Vancouver?
