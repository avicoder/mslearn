####  1. One of your colleagues would like to set up a flow to write an item to a SharePoint list when they receive an email from their boss. Which of the following would get them started?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;See if any templates are available for this scenario. If one exists, use that, otherwise create a blank flow with a "When an email is received" trigger.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an instant cloud flow and set the trigger to be "When an email is received", then add an action for creating the SharePoint item.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an automated cloud flow with only one action: create an item in SharePoint.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Your department would like to set up an approval system for items that are being written to a SharePoint list. You have been assigned the task of creating the system. Using flow, what's the best approach?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an automated cloud flow from blank and add a trigger for "When a new item is created" in SharePoint, and actions for the approvals.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Generate an approval flow from the built-in SharePoint Approvals functionality on your SharePoint list.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Set up a blank flow to send approval emails to the department manager when a new item is created in the SharePoint List.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Your organization has started using lots of Approval flows, and users are complaining that they have too many approvals to keep track of. They donâ€™t know what is approved and what is still pending their approval. What is the easiest way for them to check?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Have the users navigate to the Approval Center in Power Automate.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Have the users set up Outlook rules to catch approvals so they are more visible.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Send the users to the SharePoint list, which holds the records being approved to review which ones are approved and which ones are not.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. One of your colleagues would like to post information about SharePoint items that have been approved to Twitter. Is this possible? If so, how would he do it?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No, it's not possible. SharePoint lists don't connect to Twitter directly, so there's no way to Tweet about approved items.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it's possible. He can create a flow to monitor his SharePoint list for approved items, then notify him so he can Tweet the details manually.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it's possible. He can create a flow to monitor his SharePoint list for approved items, then Tweet the details.
