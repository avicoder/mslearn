####  2. What is one way that reports and dashboards differ?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They are the same.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;In reports, you can use the slicers and filter by selecting a data point on a visual; in dashboards, you can only filter a dashboard tile in focus mode, but can't save the filter.
