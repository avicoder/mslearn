####  1. How does GitHub's top-level search bar differ from the search options available on repository tabs?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Other than being located in different parts of the user interface, they are otherwise the same.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They support different filter syntax options.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The top-level search bar supports searching everything across all of GitHub, whereas the repository tab searches are scoped to cover specific types in the current repository.

<br />

####  2. What does git blame do?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It creates a bug assigned to the last person who committed changes to the specified file.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It displays the commit history of the file.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It reverts the effects of a git praise command.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Suppose a bug issue is reported on your project, and you know which pull request introduced the problem. Which of the following options is not a cross-linking best practice?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Do not create cross-links when the root cause of the issue is already known.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add a comment to the bug report that includes the pull request's author by using an @mention.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add a comment to the bug report that links the pull request to it using the #ID syntax.
