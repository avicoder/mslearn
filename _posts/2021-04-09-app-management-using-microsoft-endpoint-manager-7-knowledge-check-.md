####  1. What are app configuration policies verses app protection policies?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;App configuration policies and app protection policies are essentially the same thing.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;App configuration policies help secure access on devices by restricting actions users can take with organizational data. App protection policies provide a method to configure how apps are set up.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;App configuration policies provide app configuration settings for both iOS/iPadOS and Android apps. App protection policies help secure your devices.

####  2. What are protected apps?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Protected apps are all apps that end users may be using on their device that are managed by a mobile device management (MDM) service.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Protected apps incorporate special mobile app management capabilities using the Intune App Software Development Kit (SDK) or the App Wrapping Tool for either iOS or Android.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Protected apps are the apps that can be run on an end user's device that are managed by a mobile device management (MDM) service.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Can app protection policies be deployed on devices that are not enrolled in any MDM service?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Your organization can use app protection policies as part of application management with and without using a mobile device management (MDM) service.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No. Your organization can only use app protection policies with the Intune mobile device management (MDM) service.
