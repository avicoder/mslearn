####  1. Which of the following is a characteristic of Azure functions and serverless?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can bring your own containers.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can automate your business process.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can integrate services using triggers and bindings.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Suppose you're responsible for managing the reliability of speech data coming from different kinds of IoT devices connected to IoT Hub. Why is IoT Hub appropriate for this scenario?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;IoT Hub provides per device identity to each device.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;IoT Hub tracks events like device creation, device failures and device connections.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;IoT Hub is hosted in the cloud.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Suppose that youâ€™re responsible for implementing AI solutions with IoT device as an event-based function. You want to explore the ability to interact with Cognitive Service. Which would be a better a solution to implement this scenario?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can configure Cognitive Service API key to trigger the function and execute your code.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can write a function that can be deployed locally, then run the function by calling Cognitive service API.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can write your code as an Azure function that is invoked by a trigger and call the Cognitive Service into the function.
