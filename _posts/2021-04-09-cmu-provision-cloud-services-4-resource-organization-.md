####  1. Which of the following tasks can't be accomplished by organizing resources into resource groups?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Aggregate billing information for all the resources

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce latency for all of the resources

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use permissions to control access to the resources as a group

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Manage the lifetime of the resources as a group
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Consider the end-to-end solution diagrammed in Figure 2.1. In that solution, wildlife photos snapped by motion-activated cameras are stored in Azure Blob Storage. Suppose you want to retain those photos even if the solution itself is deleted. Would it make more sense to make the storage resource that holds the photos part of the same resource group as the other resources in the solution, or to make it part of a different resource group?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Different resource group

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Same resource group
<br />
