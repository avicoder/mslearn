####  1. What is a sovereign cloud?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A cloud that is accessible to the public, but only to specific organizations or in specific geographies

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A cloud that can only be accessed through dedicated connections between an organization's intranet and the public cloud using services such as Azure ExpressRoute and AWS Direct Connect

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A private cloud owned by an organization that leases access to other organizations

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A cloud owned by a king or queen.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Suppose an organization wants to use a public cloud, but certain data that the organization stores must, by law, remain on-premises. What type of cloud would enable the organization to have the best of both worlds by utilizing the public cloud but comply with relevant laws regarding data storage?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Public cloud

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Private cloud

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Hybrid cloud

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sovereign cloud
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Azure ExpressRoute and AWS Direct Connect let you create high-speed private connections between Azure and AWS data centers and on-premises infrastructure. For what type of cloud would these services be useful?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Public cloud

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Private cloud

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Hybrid cloud

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sovereign cloud
