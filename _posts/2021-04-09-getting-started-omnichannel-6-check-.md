####  1. An agent is currently working in their Home session with no additional sessions open. They want to be able to search through their organization's available account list. How would they perform that task in the application?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From Session Panel

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From the Application bar

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From the Quick Create Button

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From the Customer Summary
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. While working with a customer, you invite another agent into the conversation to assist in the resolution. To get the new agent up to speed, you switch the conversation to internal. After the conversation is switched back to public, who will see the messages that you entered?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The customer

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You and the customer

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;All three of you

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You and the other agent
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. While you are engaging with a customer, how much of the conversation is used to determine the customer sentiment that is displayed in the chat window?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The entire conversation

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The last message sent

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The last five messages

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The last six messages

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The last four messages
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. After a conversation routed to an agent, and the Customer Summary screen is loaded, which section of the screen would provide the agent with any context variables that were captured?
