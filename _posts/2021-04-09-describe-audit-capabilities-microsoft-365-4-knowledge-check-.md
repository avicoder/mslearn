####  2. The audit team needs to conduct compliance investigations across emails. They need access to crucial events, such as when mail items were accessed, when mail items were replied to and forwarded. What capability can the team use?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use Advanced Auditing so that you access and investigate those events.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use Core Auditing so that you can access and investigate those events.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use alert policies to generate and view alerts on when users perform certain actions on emails.
