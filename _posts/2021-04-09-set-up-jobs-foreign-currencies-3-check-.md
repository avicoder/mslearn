####  1. You are managing a project for a customer who is located in a different country/region. The job in Business Central is set up with your local currency (LCY). After receiving the first invoice in your local currency, the customer asks to receive future invoices in their currency. How can you achieve this task?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the foreign currency in the Invoice Currency Code field on the job card.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the foreign currency in the Currency Code field on the job card.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Issue a credit memo for the first invoice and then enter the foreign currency in the Invoice Currency Code field on the job card.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This task isn't possible because entries have been posted to the job. You should reverse these entries, close the job, and then create a new one with the foreign currency in the Invoice Currency Code field on the job card.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Which one of the following options should you select when you are setting up a job and if planning and consumption is done in a local currency and invoicing to a customer is done in a foreign currency?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Assign the local currency to the job.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Assign a foreign currency to the job.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Assign an invoice currency to the job.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Don't assign currencies to the job.
