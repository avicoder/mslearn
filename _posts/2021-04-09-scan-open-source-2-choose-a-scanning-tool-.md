####  1. How can you make sure an open-source component you use doesn't have security defects?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Examine the component's documentation to understand known vulnerabilities.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Regularly scan open-source components that you use for known vulnerabilities.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use open-source code only from reputable authors.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Why is it important to assess the license that's associated with every open-source component you use?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Some licenses have provisions that might not be acceptable to your company's use of open source.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It helps you choose a license for your own open source projects.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It's not important. Open source refers to free, unrestricted use of the software.
