####  1. Which of the following is not a good reason to use microservices?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You need to deploy software to really small devices, like watches.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You want to modernize your monolithic application functionality into smaller services that can be developed and maintained independently.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You want to empower different teams to use the best technologies for each independent service in an overall solution.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. How are Docker and Kubernetes similar?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They are both effective at packaging applications into self-sufficient containers.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They both use declarative manifests to define how their constituent components are exposed.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They are both designed for orchestrating deployed containers.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Suppose your team has multiple .NET Core projects in a solution that produces multiple Docker containers. How much overhead does adding Kubernetes support require?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A lot. Kubernetes uses its own programming languages and development framework, so applications need to be rebuilt.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a bit. Containers will need to be adjusted to load Kubernetes settings and configuration data.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Very little. The application should require no changes and the containers can be produced as before. Only one or more Kubernetes manifest files that specify container requirements will need to be added.
