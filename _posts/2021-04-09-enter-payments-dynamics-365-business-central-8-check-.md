####  1. For some customers, you want to be notified by the system every time an application has a balance amount within the tolerance that is specified in the Max. Payment Tolerance field on the General Ledger Setup page. How can you achieve this outcome?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the General Ledger Setup page, enable the Payment Tolerance Warning field.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;For these customers, on the customer card, enable the Payment Tolerance Warning field.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;For these customers, run the Check Payment Tolerance Warning function when you are applying a payment.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enable the Payment Tolerance Warning field for all the currencies that are assigned to the customers that you want to be notified for.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. What happens when you run the Unapply Entries function for customer ledger entries that are already applied?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amount on the selected customer ledger entries is replaced by the original amount and the Open field is selected.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;New customer ledger entries are created to reverse the closed ones.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;New detailed customer ledger entries are created to reopen the customer ledger entries that are already closed.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;New general journal lines are created, and you will need to post these lines manually.
