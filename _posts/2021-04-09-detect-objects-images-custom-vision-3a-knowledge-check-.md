####  1. Which of the following results does an object detection model typically return for an image?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A class label and probability score for the image

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bounding box coordinates that indicate the region of the image where all of the objects it contains are located

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A class label, probability, and bounding box for each object in the image
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You plan to use a set of images to train an object detection model, and then publish the model as a predictive service. You want to use a single Azure resource with the same key and endpoint for training and prediction. What kind of Azure resource should you create?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Cognitive Services

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Custom Vision

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Computer Vision
