####  1. In which of the following scenarios would you be most likely to leverage Single Resource Optimization?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To optimize all of tomorrow scheduled and unscheduled item.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To automatically schedule an emergency work order.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To schedule high priority work orders throughout the day.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. One of your customer’s has a technician they prefer to work with.  The technician is currently scheduled to work on a work order for the customer.  You want to ensure that when RSO runs, the booking can be moved to different times as needed, but only if the currently scheduled tech does the work.  How accomplish this for the booking?
