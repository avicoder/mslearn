####  1. You're the Enterprise Administrator for Tailspin Toys, Inc. You have on-premises Skype for Business users who are simultaneously using Microsoft Teams. However, they're unable to inter-operate with Skype for Business users from their Teams client. They also can't communicate with users in federated organizations from their Teams client. You want to provide both of these functions to your users in Teams. To do so, you must move the users from on-premises Skype for Business to the cloud. Doing so requires that you configure a hybrid Skype for Business deployment. Once you've configured this hybrid deployment, what must you do to provide your users with inter-operability and federation support from their Teams client?

####  2. You're the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, which has a Microsoft Enterprise E5 subscription. Contoso already uses SharePoint Online to support its collaboration efforts between users and teams. However, you're interested in creating a hybrid SharePoint environment to maximize collaboration. Of all the extra features that a hybrid SharePoint environment will provide, you're most interested in creating a modern productivity experience for your users. In this environment, your users will have a more seamless experience when navigating between Contoso's on-premises SharePoint Server and Microsoft 365. To achieve this result, which of the following features should you configure with the help of the SharePoint Online Hybrid Picker tool?
