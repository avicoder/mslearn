####  1. What is the benefit of the system focused approach?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This approach allows you to focus on one critical asset at a time to help identify all potential threats and ways to reduce or eliminate risk

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This approach provides information into a potential attacker, including their means, motive, and plan of action

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This approach allows you to focus on how the system handles users and data. It also validates security assumptions across physical and logical assets used with the service

####  2. What is the benefit of the attacker focused approach?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This approach allows you to focus on one critical asset at a time and identifies all potential threats and ways to reduce risk

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of focusing on the service, this approach focuses on the attacker, their motivations and means to attack your system

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This approach provides information into the system, especially as it handles errors and requests
