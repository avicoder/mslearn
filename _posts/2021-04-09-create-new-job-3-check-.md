####  1. Which one of the following statements about the Status field on a job card is true?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can only post usage to a job with a status of Open.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can't switch a job back to a previous status.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It isn't possible to skip the Quote status for a job.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can only set up task lines for a job with a status of Planning or Quote.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. How can you create a new job with planning that reflects actual usage and invoicing of items, resources, and general ledger expenses of an existing job?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This action is not possible. You must always set up planning lines manually for a new job.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a new job with the Copy Job function. On the Copy Job Card page, select the job to copy from and then set the Source field to Job Ledger Entries.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Export the job ledger entries for the job that you want to use as a source to Microsoft Excel. Copy the entries to an Excel template for job planning lines and import into Business Central.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Open the job ledger entries for the job that you want to use a source, filter the entries if necessary, and then run the Copy to New Job function.
