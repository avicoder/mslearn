####  1. On the reclassification journal lines, you didn't select the Insert Bal. Account field. After entering all the lines correctly, you select Reclassify in the ribbon. What should you do next?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing; everything is reclassified as it should be

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the FA G/L journal to post the journal lines that the reclassify function has created

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the FA journal to post the journal lines that the reclassify function has created

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Run the Post Reclassification Lines batch job
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You decide to sell a segment of an asset that is registered as a single asset in the program. How can you dispose of the part of the asset that will be sold?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To dispose of a part of the asset, create a new asset for the part to be sold, use the reclassification journal to reclassify the asset into two assets, and then dispose of the resulting part.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To dispose of a part of the asset, assign a new depreciation book to the asset, use the reclassification journal to reclassify the asset into two assets, and then dispose of the resulting part.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To dispose of a part of the asset, create a new asset for the part to be sold, use the reclassification journal to combine the assets into one asset, and then dispose of the resulting part.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a sales invoice and use the Quantity field on the sales line to specify how much of the asset should be sold. For example, if you want to sell one-fourth of the total acquisition cost and depreciation amount, enter 0.25 in the Quantity field.
