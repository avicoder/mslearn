####  1. In which of the following WIP calculation methods are revenues and costs not recognized until the job is finished?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Completed Contract

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Percentage of Completion

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Cost Value

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sales Value
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You only want to allow the Sales Value and Completed Contract job WIP methods for your projects. What can you do to prevent users from selecting one of the other job WIP methods when they set up a new job?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the Job WIP Methods page, delete the WIP methods that aren't allowed.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the Job WIP Method Card page, select Blocked for the WIP methods that aren't allowed.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When setting up a new job, users can always select any job WIP method that they want.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the Job WIP Methods page, clear the Valid field for the WIP methods that aren't allowed.
