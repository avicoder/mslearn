####  1. How do you create a multilingual report?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To display a report in the language of the user, you would use labels and the IncludeCaption property. To display a report in the language of the recipient, you would use the FieldCaption and TextConstants functions in the dataset.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Business Central isn't multilingual; everything is always in English.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A report can only be displayed in the language of the user. To print it in a different language, you need to change the language in the application and then print the report again.

####  2. Where can a user change the language of the UI in Business Central?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The language setting on the Role page

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Country field on the Company Setup page

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Language field on the My Settings page

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The country code on the User page
