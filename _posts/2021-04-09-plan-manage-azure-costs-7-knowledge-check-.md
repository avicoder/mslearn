####  1. Which is the best first step the team should take to compare the cost of running these environments on Azure versus in their datacenter?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They're just test environments. Spin them up and check the bill at the end of the month.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Assume that running in the cloud costs about the same as running in the datacenter.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Run the Total Cost of Ownership Calculator.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. What's the best way to ensure that the development team doesn't provision too many virtual machines at the same time?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Do nothing. Let the development team use what they need.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Apply spending limits to the development team's Azure subscription.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Verbally give the development lead a budget and hold them accountable for overages.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Which is the most efficient way for the testing team to save costs on virtual machines on weekends, when testers are not at work?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Delete the virtual machines before the weekend and create a new set the following week.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Deallocate virtual machines when they're not in use.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Just let everything run. Azure bills you only for the CPU time that you use.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. Resources in the Dev and Test environments are each paid for by different departments. What's the best way to categorize costs by department?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Apply a tag to each virtual machine that identifies the appropriate billing department.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Split the cost evenly between departments.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep a spreadsheet that lists each team's resources.
