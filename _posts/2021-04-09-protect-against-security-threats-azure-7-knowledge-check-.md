####  1. How can Tailwind Traders enforce having only certain applications run on its VMs?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Connect your VMs to Azure Sentinel.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an application control rule in Azure Security Center.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Periodically run a script that lists the running processes on each VM. The IT manager can then shut down any applications that shouldn't be running.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. What's the easiest way for Tailwind Traders to combine security data from all of its monitoring tools into a single report that it can take action on?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Collect security data in Azure Sentinel.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Build a custom tool that collects security data, and displays a report through a web application.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Look through each security log daily and email a summary to your team.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Which is the best way for Tailwind Traders to safely store its certificates so that they're accessible to cloud VMs?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Place the certificates on a network share.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Store them on a VM that's protected by a password.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Store the certificates in Azure Key Vault.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. How can Tailwind Traders ensure that certain VM workloads are physically isolated from workloads being run by other Azure customers?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Configure the network to ensure that VMs on the same physical host are isolated.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This is not possible. These workloads need to be run on-premises.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Run the VMs on Azure Dedicated Host.
