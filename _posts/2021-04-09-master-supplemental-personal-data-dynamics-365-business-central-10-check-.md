####  1. Are users able to delete master data at any time?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;As the owner of your data, you can decide to delete master data at any time.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Business Central will only allow you to delete master data when it's safe to do so. Before you can delete master data, you might need to execute other actions first, like closing a fiscal year or processing orders.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Master data cannot be deleted as this data is critical to the functioning of Business Central.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only administrators and developers can delete data in Business Central.

####  2. What is the consequence of checking the privacy blocked field on a record?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When a record is marked as privacy blocked, you cannot create new transactions that use that record. For example, you can't create a new invoice for a customer when either the customer or the salesperson is blocked.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When a record is marked as privacy blocked, it will be deleted the next time as you run the GDPR batch job.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When a record is marked as privacy blocked, you cannot segment this record in Business Central.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When a record is marked as privacy blocked, you will be warned that this is sensitive data to use.
