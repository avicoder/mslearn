####  1. Your organization requires that a travel requisition be submitted before an employee incurs an expense that is charged to the organization. Which of the following situations does this requirement apply to?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Charging expenses to a corporate credit card

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Spending cash that has been received from a cash advance

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Incurring out-of-pocket expenses

<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. What happens if any approver in the workflow returns a travel requisition?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The travel requisition is returned to the workflow originator, who is the user who submitted the requisition.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The travel requisition is returned to the previous approver, if applicable. If no other approver is listed, it is sent to the workflow originator.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The travel requisition is sent to the next approver.
<br />
<br />
