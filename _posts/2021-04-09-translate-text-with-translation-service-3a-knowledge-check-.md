####  1. You are developing an application that must take English input from a microphone and generate a real-time text-based transcription in Hindi. Which service should you use?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Translator Text

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Speech

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Text Analytics
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You need to use the Translator Text service to translate email messages from Spanish into both English and French? What is the most efficient way to accomplish this goal?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Make a single call to the service; specifying a "from" language of "es", a "to" language of "en", and another "to" language of "fr".

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Make a single call to the service; specifying a "from" language of "es", and a "to" language of "en-fr".

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Make two calls to the service; one with a "from" language of "es" and a "to" language of "en", and another with a "from" language of "es" and a "to" language of "fr"
