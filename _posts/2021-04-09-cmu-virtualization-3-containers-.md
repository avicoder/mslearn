####  1. Which of the following statements regarding containers is NOT true?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because containers are smaller than VMs, they start faster, consume fewer resources, and are more easily transported from one server to another

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because containers are smaller than VMs, a server can typically host more containers than it can VMs

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Containers permit different operating systems to run side by side on the same computer

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Containers virtualize the operating system; they do not virtualize hardware
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You are trying to decide whether an application that your company built and wants to replicate should be hosted in a VM or a container. The application is a web application that runs on Linux and Node.js. However, rather than store data in the local file system, the app stores data in Azure Blob Storage. Is this app a candidate for containerization?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but only if it is rewritten so that it doesn't rely on Azure Storage

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. What is the difference between a container and a container image?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A container can run on Linux or Windows, but a container image can only run on Linux

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A container is an instance of a container image

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A container image hosts running applications, while a container provides the manifest that specifies what's loaded into a container image

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no difference between containers and container images; the terms are synonymous
