####  1. Which statement about calculated tables is true?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Calculated tables increase the size of the data model.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Calculated tables are evaluated by using row context.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Calculated tables are created in Power Query.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Calculated tables cannot include calculated columns.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Which statement about calculated columns is true?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Calculated columns are created in the Power Query Editor window.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Calculated column formulas are evaluated by using row context.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Calculated column formulas can only reference columns from within their table.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Calculated columns can't be related to non-calculated columns.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. You're developing a Power BI desktop model that sources data from a Microsoft Azure SQL database. The database has an employee table that stores one row for each employee. Each row has a reference to the employee's manager, which is also a row in the employee table. You need to add several columns to the Employee table in your model to analyze payroll data within the organization hierarchy. Which technique will you use to add the columns?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add persisted columns to a table by using T-SQL.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add column expressions in a view by using T-SQL.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add computed columns by using M.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add calculated columns by using DAX.
