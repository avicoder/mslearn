####  1. What should a continuous security approach include?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Manual remediation in environments with combined legacy and modern application platforms

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Secure software delivery, secure infrastructure and secure automation

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Distributed denial of service, mobile malware, DNS
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Which defensive mindset is appropriate to take?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;With enough automation of security checks in the continuous delivery system, you will be able to protect the majority of threats.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Defensive mechanisms are layered to protect valuable data and information.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;High tech companies are less likely to be attacked.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. What are three principles of DevOps that most apply to continuous security?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Shift left, automation and continuous improvement

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Customer-focused design, OKRs, metrics

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous operations, lean product and shift-right testing
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. Continuous Operations reduces or eliminates the need for planned downtimes or interruptions, such as scheduled maintenance. What should continuous monitoring of infrastructure, applications, and services be tied to, if possible?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Security scanning

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sprint planning

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Automated remediation
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  5. A large part of the value of DevOps in general is about finding the right balance between which of the following?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Innovation (speed) and business continuity (control)

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion (iteration) and implementation (deployment)

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Estimation (planning) and achievability (results)
<br />
<br />
<br />
