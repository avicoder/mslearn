####  1. Which cloud deployment model would be the best match for the following situation? A SQL server database is needed for a short-term project. The IT department does not have available hardware that meets the performance requirements or resources to deploy it. The project starts next week. Once the project is over, the database is no longer needed.

####  2. Which cloud deployment model is described in the following scenario? You create several virtual machines in the cloud. The VMs are networked together using a virtual network. The VMs have access to x-ray image files in cloud storage. One of the VMs is a web server that host a website exposed to the Internet for customers to access their records. There is a VPN that connects the solution to your on-premises datacenter for customer information to display with the image files.

####  3. Which cloud deployment model is described in the following scenario? You have two datacenters in your organization. One datacenter has a database that can only reside in one of the datacenters because of a regulatory requirement. You want to access the database from the other datacenter. You create a VPN using a cloud provider to connect the two datacenters.
