####  1. Suppose a customer of a bank transfers $1,000 into another customer's account and obtains a successful transaction message. Five minutes later, the second customer checks their account online and doesn't see the transaction listed. Which of the ACID properties was most clearly violated in the case of this transaction?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The atomicity of the transaction

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The consistency of the transaction

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The isolation of the transaction

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The durability of the transaction
