####  1. Which of the following is not an important consideration for migrating a source repository to GitHub?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to keep all of the version control history?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is there project data that lives outside of the history you need to preserve, such as issues, discussions, or pull requests?

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Does GitHub support the programming language your project uses?
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Why is a .gitignore file important to your repository?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It defines which users are not allowed to participate in your repository discussions and pull requests.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It helps you enforce policy around which files are not to be tracked by version control.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It's just a token file required by GitHub to make sure you're following the migration instructions closely. If you ignore it, your repository migration will fail.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Which of the following is not a valid way to migrate a project to GitHub?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Email a password protected zip of your project to GitHub support along with instructions for the repository's creation. Be sure to include the zip password in the same email.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the git client or other git-friendly tool to upload your project.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the GitHub Importer to import your project.
