####  1. You have created a fixed asset location for warehouse EAST. What can you use the fixed asset location for?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Each fixed asset that is assigned to fixed asset location warehouse EAST is automatically created as an item for location EAST so that you can track the fixed asset values in the inventory application area.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;By using fixed asset locations, you can assign zones and bins to fixed assets, which makes it easier to find them in the warehouse.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A fixed asset location is automatically created as a dimension value. You can set up analysis views based on the fixed asset locations.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can use fixed asset locations to filter lists and reports and to analyze assets by location.

####  2. Last month, you created a new fixed asset to which you assigned the FA subclass MACHINERY. After posting the acquisition cost and the first depreciation, you want to change the FA subclass to EQUIPMENT. Is this possible?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but only if you change the FA posting group on the Depreciation Books FastTab to EQUIPMENT.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but only after reversing the posted acquisition cost and depreciations.
