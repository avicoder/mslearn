####  1. The Dynamics 365 Customer Voice connector in Power Automate has two actions that can be used in a flow. Which of the following are the two actions that exist?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a survey and Send an invitation

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an invitation and Send a survey

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Send a survey and Create a survey
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Variables can be added to a survey, providing the ability to personalize the survey for each respondent. When you are sending survey invitations, the variables are passed through and come back in with the survey response. Where is the context data stored?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The context data is stored on the survey invitation that is sent to a respondent.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The context data is stored at the survey level.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The context data is stored on the survey response record.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. A survey can be created in up to 23 languages. When you are using multilingual surveys, all the questions, subtitles, and options can be translated. Which two ways determine the correct language to display for a recipient?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The language that is set on the recipient's browser and the locale variable that is used in conjunction with Microsoft Power Automate

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The IP address of the recipient and the locale variable that used in conjunction with Microsoft Power Automate

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The language that is set on the recipient's browser and the country variable that is used in conjunction with Microsoft Power Automate
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. When creating new variables, you can add a default value. This value can be populated on a survey. What is the purpose of the default value?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;If text is added to the default value of a variable on a survey, this text is the one that will always be used for any survey invitation that is sent out.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The default value will always be ignored and is only used as a visual indicator to the survey maker to explain the purpose of the variable.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When you are using Power Automate and sending out survey invitations, the default value is replaced by the actual value from a data source when the survey is sent.
