####  1. In which of the following scenarios would a routing rule be applied to a case record?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Automatically, when a case is manually created

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When an agent selects the Save button

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When an agent selects the Add to Queue button

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When a case is created automatically
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You've been asked to configure a custom entity called IoT Alert so that alerts can be routed and distributed to agents in Omnichannel for Customer Service.  What needs to be done on the entity first?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a work stream for the IoT Alert entity

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a routing rule set

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enable the entity for Queues

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enable change tracking for Microsoft Flow
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. What is the maximum number of allowed active Routing Rule sets that can be defined for a single entity?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;One active Routing Rule set

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Two active Routing Rule sets

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Five active Routing Rule sets

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ten active Routing Rule sets

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No limit
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. Prior to deploying Omnichannel for Customer Service, your organization had already created multiple queues that are being used by Customer Service Hub to route case records to queues. What will you need to do to allow those queues to be used with Omnichannel for Customer Service?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No additional configuration is required; it will work automatically

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enable the queue for Automatic Distribution

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Configure an incoming email address for the queue

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Existing Customer Service Hub queues cannot be used with Omnichannel for Customer Service

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Configure the queue as a private queue
<br />
<br />
<br />
