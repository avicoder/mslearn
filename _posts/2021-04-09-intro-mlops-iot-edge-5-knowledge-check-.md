####  2. MLOps brings the philosophy of DevOps to the Data science community. In the absence of MLOPs, how would the work of a data scientist be impacted?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A data scientist won't be able to conduct experiments.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A data scientist won't be able to test models.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A data scientist wouldn't be able to collaborate with developers efficiently.

<br />

####  3. A company has decided to implement MLOps on Edge devices. Which step would they need to implement before deploying MLOPs on Edge devices?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The company should deploy IoT Edge and capture data from sensors.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The company should be able to visualize data from sensors.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Developers should follow CI/CD processes before MLOps is deployed.
