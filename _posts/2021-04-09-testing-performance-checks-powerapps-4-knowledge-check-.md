####  1. When working with relational data what is a common mistake that can have a drastic negative impact?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Power Apps does not support relational data.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You use a LookUp function to query the data source directly in a Gallery.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You do not collect all of the data, regardless of size, in the OnVisible property.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You do not collect all of the data, regardless of size, in the OnStart property.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Which of the following statement is true regarding Experimental features?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Experimental features are guaranteed to work.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Experimental features should always be enabled in your app.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Experimental features may or may not change, break or disappear from your app.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Experimental features are only okay to use one at a time but are fully supported.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. When building your app which of the following is the most correct statement?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You must incorporate performance tuning from the start; performance is most important.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You should make your app functional first, then incorporate performance tuning as appropriate.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Performance is a nice to have but doesn't matter to the user.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Testing is a waste of time; your users will tell if you something is broken.
