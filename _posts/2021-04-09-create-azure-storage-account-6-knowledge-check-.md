####  1. Suppose you have two video files stored as blobs. One of the videos is business-critical and requires a replication policy that creates multiple copies across geographically diverse datacenters. The other video is non-critical, and a local replication policy is sufficient. Which of the following options would satisfy both data diversity and cost sensitivity consideration.


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a single storage account that makes use of Local-redundant storage (LRS) and host both videos from here.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a single storage account that makes use of Geo-redundant storage (GRS) and host both videos from here.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create two storage accounts. The first account makes use of Geo-redundant storage (GRS) and hosts the business-critical video content. The second account makes use of Local-redundant storage (LRS) and hosts the non-critical video content.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. The name of a storage account must be:


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Unique within the containing resource group.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Unique within your Azure subscription.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Globally unique.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. In a typical project, when would you create your storage account(s)?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, during project setup.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;After deployment, when the project is running.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, during resource cleanup.
<br />
