####  1. You are a cloud administrator in charge of ensuring that your organization's public-facing web site remains fast and responsive at all times. The site is hosted in an Azure App Service. It sees the heaviest traffic between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. each day, but the load is somewhat inconsistent from one day to the next. In addition, it experiences infrequent burst loads with up to 10 times the normal traffic. These bursts are difficult to predict, but slow the site to a crawl if additional resources aren't brought online rather quickly. What approach would provide the best balance between responsiveness and cost?
