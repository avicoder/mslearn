####  1. You are setting up two warehouses in Business Central. The first one is a small local warehouse that doesn't require warehouse tasks. The other one is the company's central warehouse where you want to use Warehouse Management System. How can you achieve this outcome?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Set up the small local warehouse as a responsibility center and the central warehouse as a location with directed put-away and pick enabled.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Set up the small local warehouse as a dimension and the central warehouse as a location with directed put-away and pick enabled.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can set up both warehouses as locations with directed put-away and pick enabled, but for the small local warehouse, you can clear the Bin Mandatory field.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Set up the small local warehouse as a location without the options on the Warehouse FastTab enabled and the central warehouse as a location with directed put-away and pick enabled.

<br />

####  2. Location EAST is set up with directed put-away and pick. One of your colleagues from the sales department asks if they can quickly ship an item from a sales order. What is your answer?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This setup is not possible. For locations with directed put-away and pick, you can only ship items from a warehouse shipment.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This transaction is acceptable. For locations with directed put-away and pick, you can still ship items from the sales order.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This transaction is possible, but the user must manually enter the Qty. to Ship field on the sales line.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This transaction is only possible by temporarily disabling directed put-away and pick for the location.
