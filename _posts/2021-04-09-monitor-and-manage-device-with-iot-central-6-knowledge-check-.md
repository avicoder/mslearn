####  1. Which statement best describes the information in a device template?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The hardware specification of a device connected to your application.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The data and commands a device can exchange with your application.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The over-the-wire protocol used to communicate with a device.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. True or false: you must have a physical device to test your IoT Central application.


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;True

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;False
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Suppose you have five physical devices communicating with IoT Central. How many connection strings would you have?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;One: the connection string is shared by all connected devices.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Two: one in active use and one backup in case the primary is compromised.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Five: every device needs a unique connection string.
