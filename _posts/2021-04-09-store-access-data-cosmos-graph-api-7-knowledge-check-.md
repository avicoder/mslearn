####  1. In which of the following scenarios would a graph database, as opposed to another database model, be the best fit?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Where data is disconnected and relationships do not matter

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A data model where the ability to expand the model to add new data or relationships is necessary

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;If your queries are doing table scans to find a match or searching for data
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Which of these answers is a primary strength of graph databases, as compared to other database models?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Query performance with relationships

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Storage for large data sets

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Where data models stay consistent and the structure is fixed and tabular
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. How would you model this module's scenario in a graph database?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;As a connected graph of nodes and relationships with properties and labels

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Modify the data model to fit a normalized table structure

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;We can't build a model into a graph database as we don't have enough information
<br />
<br />
<br />
