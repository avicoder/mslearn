####  1. Tailwind Traders must ensure that the data transmitted from the Canberra office to workloads running in Azure doesn't pass across the public internet, even in an encrypted tunnel. Which of the following technologies can Tailwind Traders use to connect this office to workloads running in Azure?

####  2. At present, all Tailwind Traders branch office locations link to the Sydney office by using a VPN connection. Internal network traffic between branch offices is all routed through Sydney in a hub-and-spoke architecture. Rather than use the Sydney office as the hub for routing traffic between branch offices, Tailwind Traders would prefer to use Azure. Which of the following technologies can Tailwind Traders use to accomplish this goal?
