####  1. Which of the following is not a good reason to use Docker?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You build mobile apps and want a single mobile container to run across different operating systems.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Your application has very specific dependency requirements and you want to package them along with the app itself for deployment.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You want the different stages of your CI/CD pipeline to use the same application environment to be used in production.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. How are containers and virtual machines similar?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They both run their own virtualized operating systems.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They both provide isolation for the applications they contain.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They both offer the same performance.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. How much overhead does migrating an existing .NET Core application to use a Docker container require?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A lot. Docker uses its own programming languages and development framework, so applications need to be rebuilt.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a bit. Application code will need to be adjusted to load Docker settings and configuration data.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Very little. The application should require no changes, but a Docker manifest that specifies application requirements will need to be added.
