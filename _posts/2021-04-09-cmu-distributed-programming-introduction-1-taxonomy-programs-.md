####  1. A UNIX shell script uses grep and awk to process plain text files, one at a time, in order to extract information. This program is run along with others on a UNIX OS. What kind of program is this most likely to be?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sequential

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Parallel

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Distributed

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. A robot receptionist application runs on a Linux OS and has multiple functional modules that run simultaneously to accomplish several tasks, such as speech generation and facial expressions. These functional modules are designed to be independent processes that can share time on a single processor or core. What kind of program is this most likely to be?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Parallel

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sequential
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. MATLAB includes a toolbox that automatically takes code written in MATLAB and executes it on multicore processors and/or GPUs to speed up computations. What kind of program does this toolbox most likely generate?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Distributed

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sequential
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. Folding@Home is a large-scale computing project that uses the idle time of volunteers' computers to perform complex, protein-folding simulations over the internet. What kind of program is Folding@Home most likely to be?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sequential

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Parallel

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Distributed
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  5. Which of the following statements is true in distributed programs?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Threads, process, jobs, and applications all typically share memory.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Threads that are part of a single process typically have access to the same memory space.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Threads and processes that are part of the same job typically have access to the same memory space.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;None of the above.
