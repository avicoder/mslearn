####  1. Why is it important to monitor and maintain AI systems over time?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in model reliability can be detrimental to outcomes and put people’s safety at risk.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in model reliability can lead to a freeze on a project’s funding.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in model reliability can hurt an organization’s ability to compete in the market.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in model reliability can hurt an organization’s stock price.

####  2. Why is it important to articulate how AI systems reach conclusions?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;By articulating how AI systems reach conclusions, organizations can eliminate bias from the AI’s decision-making process.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Articulating how AI reaches conclusions helps people identify the sources of biases or exclusionary practices, safety and privacy concerns, or accuracy and reliability issues.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;By articulating how AI systems reach conclusions, organizations can protect themselves from legal repercussions in cases where those decisions are allegedly biased.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Organizations should not articulate how their AI systems reach conclusions because it exposes them to legal risk and possible IP theft.

####  3. How can AI be used to address global climate issues in the agricultural industry?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;AI can be applied to data captured by drones and sensors to deliver actionable insight to farmers, increasing yield and reducing cost and environmental impact.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;AI can predict water scarcity, enabling suppliers to increase prices at optimal times to maximize profit.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;AI can predict weather patterns perfectly, increasing yields by allowing farmers to determine the best time to plant, fertilize, and harvest crops.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;AI-powered machinery will soon replace all humans in the agriculture industry, harvesting crops faster and at a higher volume.

####  4. According to the Microsoft governance model, under what conditions would a sensitive use case be categorized as “infringement on human rights”?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The scenario involves using AI in a way that could create a significant risk of physical harm to an individual.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The scenario involves using AI in a way that could possibly result in a significant restriction of personal freedom, speech, assembly, or privacy.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The scenario involves the use of AI in a way that may directly result in the denial of consequential services or support to an individual.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The scenario involves using AI in a way that could create a significant risk of emotional harm to an individual would be categorized “infringe on human rights.”
