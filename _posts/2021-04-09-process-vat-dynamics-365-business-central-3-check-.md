####  1. Which one of the following statements about prices including VAT is correct?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A sales line will always present the prices excluding VAT independently of the value in the Prices Including VAT check box, which is only used for printing purposes.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When Prices Including VAT is selected on both the item card and in the sales header, Business Central displays an error message when you try to insert the item on a sales line.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When Prices Including VAT is selected on the item card but not in the sales header, the item card will take priority and the Unit Price on the item card is copied to the Unit Price incl. VAT field on the sales line.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to manually change the value of the Prices Including VAT check box in the sales header.
