####  1. You have been asked to build a Power Automate flow that uses an API from Fabrikam. You have decided to build a custom connector because a built-in connector isn't available for the API. After reviewing the API documentation, you discover that it has an Open API definition file and examples that could be used with Postman. Considering the possibilities, which approach makes the most sense to quickly get started building the custom connector?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the examples, build a Postman collection, and then import that collection.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Import the Open API definition file to start your custom connector configuration.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Open API file as a reference and then manually add the actions to your new custom connector.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Run the samples, capture the network trace, and upload the trace to create the connector.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Which of the following authentication types is not supported by custom connectors?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymous

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Cookie Authentication

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;API Key

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;OAuth 2.0
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. You have built a custom connector and want to make it available to other companies, similar to built-in connectors. What should you do?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Share the connector in the portal.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Submit the connector for certification.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Publish your connector on Microsoft AppSource.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Publish the connector on GitHub as an open source.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. You have imported an Open API definition and it included 10 actions. For now, two actions should not be visible to users of the connectors, but you might make them available later. What should you do to implement this preference?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add words (HIDDEN) to the actions' names.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Select them as internal.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Share only the actions that you want people to use.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Disable access to actions in a security role.
<br />
<br />
