####  1. What is the Azure Instance Metadata Service?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The framework that's used to authenticate to an IaaS (infrastructure as a service) VM

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A REST API endpoint that's accessible from an IaaS VM

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A service that contains detailed data for provisioned Azure resources

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The service used for service principal objects

####  2. Why can't a custom application that's hosted on-premises use managed identities?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Custom applications don't support managed identities.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Managed identities are supported only in Azure AD.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Managed identities can be used only with Azure resources.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Managed identity is a feature of Azure virtual machines.
