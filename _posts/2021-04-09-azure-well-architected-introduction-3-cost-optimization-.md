####  1. Which of the following is an example of waste, resulting in an increased resource cost?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Archiving infrequently accessed data to an archive storage tier.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Using a service that automatically adjusts resources that are provisioned to match user load.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pooling databases to share provisioned capacity.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Running a development environment overnight that is used only during business hours.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Which of the following is a good practice to reduce costs?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Conducting regular reviews of cloud bills to identify abnormal increases in spend.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Letting all IT teams have access to provision virtual machines of any size.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Provisioning the same capacity in development environments as for production, even though resource requirements are substantially lower in development environments.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Provisioning virtual machines that include licensing costs rather than using a bring-your-own-license image.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Suppose you have recently moved your application to the cloud and your monthly bill seems higher than expected. The utilization level of your VM is high enough that you're hesitant to downsize. What might be a reasonable next step you can take to help you find inefficiencies?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Wait a month and recheck your bill.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Increase the amount of application testing you do before each release.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add monitoring and instrumentation to your application.
