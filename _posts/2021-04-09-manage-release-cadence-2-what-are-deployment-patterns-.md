####  1. The marketing team has asked you to add a banner to your company's website. They have two versions of this banner. They want to know which version produces more clickthroughs. Which deployment pattern might you use to help the marketing team identify the better version?

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A/B testing

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Feature toggles
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You have a new feature for your website, and you're ready to deploy it. However, this feature is risky because it changes the way your users interact with the site. Which deployment patterns might you use to release to a small group of early adopters who have signed up to see new features?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A/B testing or a dark launch

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Blue-green deployment or feature toggles
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. You're not sure how your users will react to your new feature. You want to release your feature to a small, random sample of users to see how they react. Which deployment pattern might you use?
