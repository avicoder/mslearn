####  1. How do Surface for Business devices drive employee engagement and retention?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Surface for Business devices decrease the cost of hardware to an organization, and that is what drives retention.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Surface devices that run Microsoft 365 are easy to deploy and manage with Intune, while protected by the security of Windows 10 Pro.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because Surface for Business devices are physically locked to an employees' desk, IT can manage local devices more easily.

####  3. What are the most important benefits of running Microsoft 365 software on the Surface for Business hardware it was built for, for an organization?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;With Surface, some employees can work wherever they want to, and some others can utilize the optimized battery life and portability.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Surface for Business devices can only be updated with Microsoft 365 software every other year, so IT doesn't have to deal with updates so often.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Running Microsoft 365 on Surface devices provides a powerful user experience, offers advanced security, and empowers employees to do more.
