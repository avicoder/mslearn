####  1. You're getting ready to ingest customer data that is currently stored in a custom build Access data base into Customer Insights.  Which ingestion option should you use?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Import data

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Connect to a Common Data Model folder

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Connect to a Microsoft Dataverse folder

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Access databases cannot be ingested into Customer Insights
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You're currently walking through the process of ingesting different data sources into Customer Insights.  You want to ensure data captured in a field called Total Cost on one of your data sources will be available to use appropriately in items like Measures.  During the transformation process, what data type should you assign to the Total Cost field to ensure it will be tracked stored and calculated correctly?

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Currency

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Text
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. You've completed the process of ingesting data from three different data sources into Customer Insights.  You want to view the underlining data that was ingested for each of the data sources.  Where in the Customer Insights user interface would you look to see the ingested items from the data source?
