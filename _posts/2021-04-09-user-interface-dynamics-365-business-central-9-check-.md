####  2. How can you directly change your role center in Business Central?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Go to My Settings, and in the Role Center field, select the role center that you want to use.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot change the role center directly. You need to sign out and then sign in again.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot change your role center yourself. This action must be done by the administrator in configuration mode.

####  3. Can a user zoom in to all the data of a page's underlying table?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No, there is no zoom functionality on pages in Business Central.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but not by default. You will need to install the Zoom app from AppSource first.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, with the Inspect pages and data feature in Help and Support. You can get details about a page, insight into the page design, the different elements that comprise the page, and the source behind the data that it displays. It allows you to zoom into all the data for the underlying table.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can only zoom with the on-premises version of Business Central.
