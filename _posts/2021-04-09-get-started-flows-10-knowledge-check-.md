####  1. How can you create a flow that reoccurs daily?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create the flow and connect the flow to a calendar.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create the flow and set the flow flag frequency to daily reoccurrence.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Set the Schedule â€“ Recurrence trigger frequency to daily and interval to 1.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create the flow and set the flow flag frequency to hourly and the value to 24.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Every flow has two main parts, a trigger, and one or more actions. Which of the following best describes an action?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Actions are what you want to happen when a trigger is invoked.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Actions will trigger the frequency of the flow reoccurrence.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Triggers are what you want to happen when an action is invoked.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Flow actions trigger the flow to occur as long as the defined value of the trigger is met.

####  3. You would like to be alerted to when a change is made to a SharePoint list, what are some ways in which Power Automate can help?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Power Automate can send up a flare near you to alert you of changes.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can write a flow with Power Automate to send push notifications, texts or emails for a variety of triggers.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, Power Automate can't help with that.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Power Automate can send out a tweet whenever a list item is changed.
