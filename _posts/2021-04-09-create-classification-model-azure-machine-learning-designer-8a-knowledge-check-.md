####  1. You are using Azure Machine Learning designer to create a training pipeline for a binary classification model. You have added a dataset containing features and labels, a Two-Class Decision Forest module, and a Train Model module. You plan to use Score Model and Evaluate Model modules to test the trained model with a subset of the dataset that was not used for training. Which additional kind of module should you add?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Join Data

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Split Data

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Select Columns in Dataset
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You use an Azure Machine Learning designer pipeline to train and test a binary classification model. You review the model's performance metrics in an Evaluate Model module, and note that it has an AUC score of 0.3. What can you conclude about the model?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The model can explain 30\% of the variance between true and predicted labels.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The model predicts accurately for 70\% of test cases.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The model performs worse than random guessing.
<br />

<br />

####  3. You use Azure Machine Learning designer to create a training pipeline for a classification model. What must you do before deploying the model as a service?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an inference pipeline from the training pipeline

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add an Evaluate Model module to the training pipeline

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Clone the training pipeline with a different name
