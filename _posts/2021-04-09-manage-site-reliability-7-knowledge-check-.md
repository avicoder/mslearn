####  1. Which action is NOT something a site reliability engineer would do?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure the software has good logging and diagnostics.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Set up the server environment for testing.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Proactively monitor and review application performance.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Application Insights will send a performance degradation notification in which of the following scenarios?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A site dependency is responding more slowly than it used to.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A customer complaint bug is filed from the web site.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The database query returns no rows and an error is logged.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. When writing alerts, you want to alert on symptoms rather than causes. What is an example of a symptom-based alert?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The data sync from the replicated server failed.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;There was a network outage in the Eastern region.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Users in Australia cannot reach the web site.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. What is the state of an alert that an administrator has reviewed?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;New.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Closed.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Acknowledged.
