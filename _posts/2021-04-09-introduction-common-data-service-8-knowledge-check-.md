####  1. How can business rules be used in both canvas and model-driven apps?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To validate data and show error messages.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Show or hide fields.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Manage solution development and data storage.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Your manager has built a solution using the Microsoft Dataverse using a few of the standard tables included out of the box. He wants to capture the date that new records are added to the Entity, but he isn't sure how. He notices that a "Date" field is already inside his Entity, but he wants the field to have a custom name of "Date Confirmed". What would you recommend he do?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a new table with the name "Date Confirmed".

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the built-in Date column within the table to store the date values, but rename the column to "Date Confirmed".

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a new Environment with the name "Date Confirmed".
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. One of your co-workers has set up a Model-driven application using Dataverse. The app captures information about computer hardware assets, including their price. Your co-worker is concerned that users of the application are going to forget to populate the cost center if the part is expendable. How could this be prevented?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use Power Automate to validate that the cost center column value is populated.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use a Business Rule to make the cost center field required if the expendable field is true.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use a Canvas App instead of a Model-driven app.
