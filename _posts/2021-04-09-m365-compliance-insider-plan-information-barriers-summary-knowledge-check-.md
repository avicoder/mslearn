####  1. The primary use case of information barriers is represented in which of the following statements?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;An individual wants to keep their work private from the public.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A department is handling information that should not be shared with other groups or departments.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;An organization wants to break down silos and allow searching across all business units.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Instead of blocking communications between two segments, you decide you want to allow communications to occur between certain segments. What should you do?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Edit a policy

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Edit a segment

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Edit user account attributes
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Can you use address book policies and information barrier policies at the same time?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only when address book policies were in place first
<br />
<br />
<br />
