####  1. After you posted the acquisition cost of a new car, you want to assign the fixed asset to an existing insurance policy in Business Central. How can you accomplish this task?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the acquisition cost amount of the fixed asset on the insurance card.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Insurance journal, where you can link the fixed asset with the insurance.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the FA journal, where you can link the fixed asset with the insurance.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the FA G/L journal, where you can link the fixed asset with the insurance.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. What happens when you post a disposal entry for a fixed asset to the depreciation book that is selected in the Insurance Depr. Book field in the Fixed Asset Setup window?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A fixed assetâ€™s insurance coverage automatically terminates.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The insurance policy is deleted automatically.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The program prepares a line with a negative amount in the Insurance journal.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing. You must manually post a line with a negative amount from the Insurance journal for the disposal amount.
