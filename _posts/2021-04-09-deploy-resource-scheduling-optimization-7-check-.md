####  1. You have been asked to define an optimization scope that will only optimize currently scheduled work orders that are for preventative maintenance. What entity record that is used by the optimization scope will work with currently scheduled items?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Resource Requirement

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bookable Resource Booking

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Bookable Resource

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Work Order
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Which of the following objectives cannot be used as the first objective in an Optimization Goal?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Minimize total travel time

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Maximize total working hours

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;High priority requirements

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Maximize preferred resources
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Recently, someone in your organization modified an existing optimization schedule to reference a different optimization scope. You notice that when the job is running, it does not appear to be using the new scope that was defined. Which of the following optimization schedule statuses would identify that the published version of the optimization schedule does not match the current version?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Under Maintenance

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Unpublished

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Out of Sync

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Failed
<br />
<br />
<br />
