####  1. By using automation, what is your best way to communicate Power Platform policies?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Send makers an email when they have built their first flow or app by using Power Platform Management connectors and Power Automate.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Display policy information in the Admin Analytics reports in the Power Platform Admin Center.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Display policy information in the Power Automate maker portal.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Update the terms and conditions statements in the Power Platform Admin Center.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Suppose you have two Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies. Within policy one is the Microsoft Teams connector and the Office 365 Users connector in the Business data only data group. Policy two contains the SharePoint and Office 365 Groups connectors in the Business data only data group. What happens if you try to create a flow that includes Microsoft Teams and SharePoint connectors within the same flow?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The flow is successfully saved and remains in an enabled state.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The flow is successfully saved, runs for 30 minutes, and then is disabled.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The flow is successfully saved but is immediately disabled due to a DLP violation.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The flow is not successfully saved, and the maker will lose all of their work.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. What role is needed for creating environment-wide DLP policies?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Admin

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;User

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Application
