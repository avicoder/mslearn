####  1. As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, you're planning to deploy ADFS for your Microsoft 365 deployment. Because the applications that require security tokens are often critical for Contoso, you're concerned about the failure of an application that AD FS enables. To address this concern, you want to make the AD FS service highly available, and you want to distribute application requests. Which of the following AD FS best practices will achieve these goals?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Deploy multiple AD FS nodes for high availability and balancing the load

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Domain controllers should be deployed on the same network as the AD FS servers

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Never expose security token service (STS) servers directly to the Internet
