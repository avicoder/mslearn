####  1. What is AppSource?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;AppSource is a link to the source developers of an app. By reading the AppSource tag, you can identify the object by means of developer, version, and date of the source code of the app.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;AppSource is the Microsoft marketplace for business applications like Business Central. You can find many ready-to-use apps for Business Central in AppSource. Some extensions are provided by Microsoft, and other extensions are provided by other companies. The apps add functionality, change behavior, or give you access to new online services. All extensions are tested before they are made available.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;AppSource is a suite of apps, services, connectors, and data platforms that provides a rapid application development environment to build custom apps for your business needs.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;AppSource is cloud-based software platform that allows employees to create and automate solutions across multiple applications and services without help from developers.

####  2. What is an extension?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Extensions are an object-based programming model that helps you define extra functionality to modify the behavior of the Business Central application. You can create extensions to modify existing objects such as tables, pages, and so on.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Extensions refer to third-party software solutions that you can use to add and plug in to the standard business central functionality.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Extensions are small software programs that customize the browsing experience for the Business Central web client in terms of preferences and individual needs.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Extensions refer to the integration of XML-based platforms with Business Central.

####  3. As a user, you want to add some fields to the customer list and then remove some fields from the customer list. Is this possible and, if so, how can you accomplish this task?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You canâ€™t add and remove fields as a user. You will have to ask an IT professional to do this for you.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can only do this when you have the right permission set and only in a sandbox environment. The changes then need to be transferred from the sandbox to the live environment.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;As a user, you can personalize pages like the customer list. In the App bar, select the Settings icon and then select Personalize. You can then add and remove fields from your customer list.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot customize pages for just one user; you can only do this for all users. You need to ask a developer to create an extension for this task.
