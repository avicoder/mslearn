####  1. During replication, what does a status of Protected indicate for a virtual machine?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Critical issues have been encountered for the VM during replication.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The VM state is healthy and is ready for migration.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Initial replication is complete and delta replication can begin.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. What happens to a Hyper-V VM during delta replication?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;VHDs on the VM are replicated one-by-one until they are all copied to Azure.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Incremental changes to on-premises disks are periodically replicated to Azure.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A Hyper-V VM snapshot is created, and disk changes are tracked using Hyper-V Replica.
