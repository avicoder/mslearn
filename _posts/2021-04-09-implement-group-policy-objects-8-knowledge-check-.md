####  1. In Adatum.com, there are two sites: London and Windsor. A single GPO (called London settings) is linked to London and another (Windsor settings) is linked to Windsor. In addition, there are two GPOs linked to the Adatum.com domain: The Default Domain GPO (which is Enforced) and a further policy: Adatum Folder Redirection (which has a link order value of 2). The Sales OU has a linked GPO called Sales Desktop settings. A user in the Sales department based in Windsor, whose user account and computer account reside in the Sales OU, is experiencing problems with settings on their computer. An administrator decides to investigate. The administrator suspects that there are conflicting settings in the various GPOs that apply to the user and their computer. Which GPO's settings take precedence?

####  2. Which of the following options contains the GPO settings?

####  3. The IT department in Adatum is deploying a new version of Microsoft Office in their on-premises environment. The administrator wants to configure settings with GPOs for Office. What should they do?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Copy the content of the Windows\PolicyDefinitions folder to the Central Store.
