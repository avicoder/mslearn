####  1. What does the Intelligent Security Graph do to keep your data safe?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It helps you detect and classify sensitive information, set policies, and apply the appropriate protection automatically. Because it's integrated into Microsoft 365, all your Office apps have this functionality.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It helps you go password-less to protect against weak and compromised credentials using secure authentication with Windows Hello, Microsoft Authenticator, and FIDO2 Security Keys.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It analyzes 6.5 trillion signals per day from a huge variety of sources and uses advanced analytics to assess and action a large amount of threat intelligence and security data.

####  2. What is a benefit for an IT worker using Microsoft 365 to protect against, detect, and respond to attacks?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They would gain visibility into security across their organization's entire digital estate through streamlined and consolidated views in Microsoft 365, powered by the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They would look through email threats one by one, searching for malware, phishing emails, or malicious links. They would then use the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph to map potential threats.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They would need to use additional "bolt-on" security solutions to respond to potential security threats, as Microsoft 365 only includes Identity & Access Management.

<br />
<br />

####  3. Why is it important to have an integrated security solution like Microsoft 365?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Disparate solutions may not integrate or interact well, creating potential vulnerabilities in an organization's security.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;An integrated solution helps you draw a perimeter around your organization to protect against vulnerabilities.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Integrated, on-premises approaches to security are holistic, simple, and perfect for organizational security.
