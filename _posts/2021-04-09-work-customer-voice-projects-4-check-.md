####  1. A Customer Service manager wants to start capturing feedback from clients on a regular basis. The organization uses Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement. Which approach makes the most sense for the manager to take to get started quickly when using Dynamics 365 Customer Voice?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Start with a blank project, add questions to a new blank survey, and then edit as needed.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Select the Customer Service Feedback template when creating a new project, which will include a related survey, and then edit as needed.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Select the Customer Visit Feedback project to begin, delete the survey, and then start with a new blank survey.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. When creating a new project, the survey creator at an organization is uncertain about which location to select from the many different locations that are available. Which environments will be displayed to the survey creator?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only Dynamics 365 environments (such as Sales, Customer Service, or Field Service) that the user has access to will be displayed.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only Microsoft Dataverse environments with a created model-driven app that the user has access to will be displayed.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;All Dataverse environments (including the default, any Dynamics 365 environments, and other Dataverse environments) that the user has access to will be displayed.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. A survey maker for an organization is working on a requirement for a new project with multiple surveys. They have opted to create a new project by using the blank option. Which of the following statements is true?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When using the blank project, it will include a new blank survey without questions, only the default variables will be present, and it will not include any branching rules.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No survey is included in a blank project, so the first one will need to be created before any customizing can be done.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;If a blank project is used, it will include one survey, which will be formatted already with preset organization branding and formatting.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. Each project includes a reports area. A main overview is included to show satisfaction metrics. For each survey, a new item is created in the reports area. What is created for each survey?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfaction metrics for each survey

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A Net Promoter Score breakdown for each survey

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A response overview with question breakdown for each survey
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  5. When creating a project, you can customize and brand the surveys by including elements like a theme, custom CSS, and thank you and footer messages. Where are the settings for these items stored?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;In Microsoft 365 under Settings for Dynamics 365 Customer Voice

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Under each individual survey

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual project level
