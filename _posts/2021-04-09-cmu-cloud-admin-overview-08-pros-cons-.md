####  1. Jack's total cost of ownership (TCO) for a single physical server is 5,000 dollars for 3 years. He is considering utilizing a server in the cloud instead. What is the ownership cost of the server per hour, rounded to the nearest cent?

####  2. Jack's total cost of ownership (TCO) for a single physical server is 5,000 dollars for 3 years. He is considering utilizing a server in the cloud instead. Assume that Jack's server utilization is around 10%. Over a span of 3 years, what is the effective number of hours that the server is used?

####  3. Jack's total cost of ownership (TCO) for a single compute server is 5,000 dollars for 3 years. He is considering utilizing a server in the cloud instead. A cloud service provider offer to rent Jack a virtualized server for 20 cents an hour. Jack needs to rent the server only for the number of hours calculated in the previous question. How much money (rounded to the nearest dollar) would Jack save if he rented his server?
