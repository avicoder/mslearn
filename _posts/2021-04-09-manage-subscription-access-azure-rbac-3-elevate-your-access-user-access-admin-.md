####  1. A user who had Owner access to a subscription has left your company. No one else has access to this subscription. How can you grant another employee access to this subscription?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Azure portal to elevate your own access.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ask the former employee for their password.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ask the former employee to sign in and select a different employee to grant their permissions to.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. A manager currently has access to the subscription that's used for the organization's production environment. They also need Owner access to the subscription that's used for the organization's development environment. How can this access be granted?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;An administrator with Owner or User Access Administrator access to the development environment can grant the manager access to the subscription.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The manager should go to the Switch directory option in the Azure portal and select the subscription.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The manager should use PowerShell to assign themselves Owner access to the subscription.
