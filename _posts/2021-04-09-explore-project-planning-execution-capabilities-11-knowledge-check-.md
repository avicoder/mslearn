####  2. Rodney, a project manager at Contoso, needs to assign resources to a new project. Rodney needs to make sure those resources meet a particular education requirement while also having enough capacity. Is this something Rodney can do in Project Operations?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Not completely. Rodney can assign a resource based on their education but not on their capacity.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Rodney can assign resources based on education and capacity.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Not completely. Rodney can assign a resource based on their capacity but he can't match a resource to a project based on their education.

####  3. Thomas is a traveling repair technician for Contoso. He is currently servicing e-bikes in two neighboring cities and needs to enter his time for each city (customer) on the days he services them. What is the best way for Thomas to track his time in the Project time entry mobile workspace?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Specify the category and activity for the time he spent.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Search by project name or customer to find the project to enter time for.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enter his time as usual but put the name of the city in the comments.
