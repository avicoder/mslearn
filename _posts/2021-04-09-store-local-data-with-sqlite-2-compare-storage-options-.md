####  1. Suppose you're building an iOS application that enables users to create music. You want the user to be able save their work to a file so that they can restart the application and continue working where they left off. In the iOS app sandbox, which folder would you save this file to?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Music

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Documents

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Library
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Suppose you want to store a small piece of data so that it's accessible between application launches. Which data storage option is the most appropriate?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Preferences

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;File system

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Relational database
