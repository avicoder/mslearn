####  1. Which of these is a good candidate for applying quantum-inspired optimization (QIO)?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You need to find a solution faster than with other optimization techniques for a fixed use case and fixed quality of solution.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You need to find a higher quality solution than with other optimization techniques for a fixed problem and fixed amount of time.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You need to consider many variables to form a more realistic model.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;All of the above.

<br />

####  2. Which optimization landscape is most ideal for applying QIO?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Landscape is structured, but smooth.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Landscape is structured, but rugged.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Landscape is completely random.

<br />

####  3. What's the difference between simulated annealing and quantum annealing?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Simulated annealing uses thermal jumps to overcome energy barriers. Quantum annealing uses quantum tunneling to travel through energy barriers.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Simulated annealing can discover only the local minimum of a cost function. Quantum annealing can discover the global minimum.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They're different names used to describe the same physical process.
