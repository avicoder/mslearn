####  1. What are your options if your country isn't supported by Microsoft's Calling Plans?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You won't be able to use Calling for Microsoft Teams until your country is supported.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can use your existing calling plan provider if your hardware and provider will support Direct Routing.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can use Calling for Microsoft Teams, but won't be able to port your existing phone numbers.
<br />

<br />

####  2. If you are using Teams Phone System and you receive a call internally from a colleague what information can Teams display?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Teams can show any information contained in your organizations Active Directory, including full name, profile pictures, and department information.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Teams can only show the phone number, like traditional caller ID on your mobile or desktop phone.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Teams can show the name and email address of the person calling, it can't display the person's phone number.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Which approach should you take to help diagnose a call quality issue being experienced by everyone in a specific office location?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a Power BI call quality report for the specific office location to track call quality issues over time.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Microsoft Teams admin center's analytics and reports, specifically the Call diagnostics report, filtering on Limited UDP traffic.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Microsoft Call Quality Dashboard can help you diagnose and explore call quality issues at the organization level. You can then drill down to specific employees at the location and review their call analytics.
