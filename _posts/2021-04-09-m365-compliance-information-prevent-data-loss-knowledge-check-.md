####  1. A user sends an email to several recipients containing 16 unique credit card numbers that match a DLP Policy with this sensitive information type. How many lines will display on the DLP Policy matches report?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;16

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;3
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Too many DLP policy false positives can have a negative effect on business production. Additionally, too many false positives can result in security teams ignoring the warnings. Microsoft sensitive information types are thoroughly tested. There is still a chance your organization may have specific needs not met by built-in sensitive information types. What do you do if your DLP incident report returns too many false positives?

####  3. Maintaining patient privacy is a top priority in the Health Care industry. As a senior care facility, what best practice should you employ using the ready-to-use U.S personal information policy template?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a custom policy to identify HIPAA-protected information.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Turn on the policy right away.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Test the policy before releasing it.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. You have already deployed data loss prevention and are using it to protect data in Microsoft Teams, Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive. You also want to protect data stored on your Windows 10 devices, so you have modified an existing policy and added Devices to the list of locations you will protect. What else must you do to begin protecting content on your Windows 10 devices?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure each device is Azure AD registered.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Onboard each device.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Once created, you can't add locations to a DLP policy, so this isn't a valid scenario.
