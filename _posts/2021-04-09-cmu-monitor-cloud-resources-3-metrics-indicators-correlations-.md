####  1. A count of requests per minute reaching a server is an example of which of the following?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A performance metric

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A performance indicator

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A correlation

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;None of the above
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. To monitor the performance of an application deployed to the cloud and determine when it needs to be scaled to meet demand, you've configured a dashboard to show the number of requests received per minute and the number of requests processed per minute. The idea is that if the count of requests processed plateaus while the count of requests received continues to grow, the server might be saturated and you need more servers. In this scenario, which of the following are you employing?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A performance metric

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A performance indicator

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A USE correlation

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A RED correlation
<br />
<br />
