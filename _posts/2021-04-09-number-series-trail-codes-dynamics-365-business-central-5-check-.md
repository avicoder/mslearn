####  1. You want to use a different number series for numbering domestic and foreign customers. You already created two number series (CDOM for domestic customers and CFOR for foreign customers). Because most of your customers are domestic customers, you assigned CDOM on the Sales & Receivables Setup page as the number series to be used for customers. What is your next step?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the Countries/Region page, in the Number Series field, assign CFOR for all foreign countries.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the Number Series page, select CDOM and then in the ribbon, select Relationships. You can now select CFOR and set a relationship between both number series.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can start creating new customers. Every time you create a new foreign customer, in the Number Series field on the customer card, select CFOR.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the Number Series page, select CDOM, and in the Relate to field, enter CFOR.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Which field on the No. Series page is used for automatic numbering?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Manual No. field

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Default No. field

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Starting No. field

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Last No. Used field
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Which of the following statements about Reason codes is true?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Reason codes are mandatory.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Reason codes cannot be used in general journals.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Reason Code Setup page allows you to link reason codes to general journals.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Reason Codes are not mandatory.
