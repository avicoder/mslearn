####  1. What's the advantage of using Azure Batch, rather than provisioning the required number of VMs for the task at hand?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because Azure Batch is a managed service, you get a discount on the compute capacity you purchase.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Azure Batch handles the scheduling and managing of nodes for you, free of charge.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only by using Azure Batch can you access the most high-performing VM SKUs on Azure.

####  2. You've analyzed a problem and found that it has 1000 separate subtasks. To solve this problem, your boss agrees to budget 20 VM nodes to run in Azure Batch. Compared to running on a single VM node of the same size, approximately how much quicker would you expect the problem's solution to be?
