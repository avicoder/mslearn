####  1. What sequences are available for you to connect with a record (Lead/Opportunity)?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;All sequences

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;All sequences created by me

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only active sequences, that were defined for the specific record type.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only deactivated sequences, that were defined for the specific record type.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. To edit a sequence you need to?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Disconnect the sequence from all connected records

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Deactivate the sequence

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Both a and b will work

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;None of the above
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. To add a step between two existing steps you need to?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no option to add a step between 2 existing steps.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Hover between the two activities and click on the '+' icon that will appear.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a new activity at the end of the sequence and drag it between the two existing steps.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Both b and c will work
