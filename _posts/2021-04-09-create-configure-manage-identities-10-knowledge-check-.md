####  1. Typically, Azure AD defines users in three ways. Cloud identities and guest users are two of the ways. What is the third way Azure AD defines users?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;As non-connected users.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;As transitional users.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;As directory-synchronized identities.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Azure AD group-based licensing makes large scale management easier. Typically, how soon are license modifications effective after group membership changes are made?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Within the timeframe of local domain controllers being refreshed.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Within minutes of a membership change.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Within 24 hours of a membership change.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Azure AD allows for the definition of two different types of groups; one type is Security groups, which are used to manage member and computer access to shared resources. What is the other type of group?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Distribution groups, which are used for communications purposes via applications such as Teams and Exchange.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Licensing groups, which are used to make it easier to administer software licenses.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft 365 groups, which provide access to shared mailboxes, calendars, SharePoint sites, and so on.
