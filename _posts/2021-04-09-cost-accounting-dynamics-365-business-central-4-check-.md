####  1. Why do companies use cost accounting?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is legally required in most countries and regions

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To get better insights on the unit cost of each individual item

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because they only care about profit and loss and therefore donâ€™t want to use balance sheet accounts.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To help them understand the costs of running a business
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. On the Cost Accounting Setup page, you set the Align G/L Account field to Automatic. What is the result of this action?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;If users change the chart of accounts, the program automatically makes a corresponding change in the chart of cost types.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;If users change the chart of cost types, the program automatically makes a corresponding change in the chart of accounts.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Both a and b are correct.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the chart of accounts are applied to the chart of cost types by using the Get Cost Types from Chart of Accounts function.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Which one of the following statements is true?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When the Check G/L Postings field on the Cost Accounting Setup page is selected, the system will check if the dimension value that is used in the transaction is created as a cost type or cost object.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Chart of Cost Types is an exact copy of the Chart of Accounts.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only a one-on-one relation is possible between the dimension values and the cost centers that are set up.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because no Balance to allocate field exists on the Cost Object Card page, it is not possible to allocate cost objects.
