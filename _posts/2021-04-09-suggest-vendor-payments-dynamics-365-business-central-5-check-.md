####  1. Which one of the following statements is correct when you are using the Suggest Vendor Payments function?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to generate payment lines with a different posting date, based on the Pmt. Discount Date.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can use the Suggest Vendor Payments batch job to summarize payments by vendor and by dimension.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A partial payment can be suggested when only a limited amount is available to pay the vendors of the highest priority.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only one payment for each vendor is suggested.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You are running the Suggest Vendor Payments batch job to pay purchase invoices, which are due in the upcoming two weeks. However, you don’t want to pay invoices too soon. For example, an invoice with a due date in 10 days should only be paid in 10 days. How can you make sure that you don't pay the invoices too soon?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;After running the Suggest Vendor Payments batch job, you must manually update the posting date of each payment journal line.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;After running the Suggest Vendor Payments batch job, on the action menu, select Copy Due Date to Posting Date.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t have to do anything special. By default, Business Central will use the due date to calculate the posting date.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the Suggest Vendor Payments batch job, enable the Calculate Posting Date from the Applies-to-Doc Due Date field.
