####  1. You created a new Partner Price list page, but you accidentally saved it under public company announcements instead of a partner channel page. How can you fix the mistake?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a shortcut under Correct Parent Page and then point it to the price list page. Hide the price list page from the site map.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Change the page's partial URL to point to the correct parent.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Edit the page and then select the correct value in the Parent Page field.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Drag and drop the page in the site map tree.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You created a Customers Only page on the portal that does not allow anonymous access, and you added this page to the main menu. Business users complained that the page is not visible in the main menu until visitors have signed in, and they want the link to be visible at all times. How can you implement this requirement?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Edit the web link and point it to the Sign In page but keep Customers Only as a title.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Starter portals do not support this functionality.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Select the Ignore Security option on the main menu's web link set.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Edit the web link and then select the Disable Page Validation option.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Business users have complained that portal search results do not include matching content of the web files attachments. You have set the Search/IndexNotesAttachments site setting to true, but the results are still not returned. What is your next step?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Check that Relevance Search is enabled in your model-driven apps in your Dynamic 365 instance.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Set the KnowledgeManagement/DisplayNotes site setting to true.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Restart the portal.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Web file attachments can't be searched in Power Apps portals.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. You have been asked to make the background darker on the portal's Home page only. The designer has provided you with a snippet of CSS that applies the effect. How would you use this CSS?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add a new home.css web file.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Replace the content of the bootstrap.min.css file.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add a new content snippet called Home/Background.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Set the Custom CSS field for the Home page.
<br />
