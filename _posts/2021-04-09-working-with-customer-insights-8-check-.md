<br />

####  2. You are defining a new customer segment. While creating the segment, you are adding to groups or data. Group 1 contains 100 records and Group 2 contains 150 records. You know that each grouping provides unique records. You want to combine the groups together so that the segment will contain 250 total records. Which option would you select?

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Union

<br />

####  3. You have gone through the process of ingesting your data into a unified customer profile. You want to use the Customer Insights Enrichment option to gain a deeper understanding of brand affiliations. What is the minimum number of fields that you need to define to use the Demographic feature?
