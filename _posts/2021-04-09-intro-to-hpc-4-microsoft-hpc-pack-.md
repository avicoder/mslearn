####  1. You're trying to advise your organization on whether to choose Azure Batch or Microsoft HPC Pack. What might be a key factor in choosing HPC Pack?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;There's a significant on-premises infrastructure that your organization doesn't want to waste. It can be used for HPC problems.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You don't want to be responsible for deciding how to optimize the way the HPC work gets allocated.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;There's no remaining licensing budget for the year.

####  2. You're trying to set up an HPC Pack topology, starting with on-premises resources. Which version of Windows Server should you use for the head node?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Server 2012 R2 or later.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Server 2016 or later.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Server 2019 or later.
