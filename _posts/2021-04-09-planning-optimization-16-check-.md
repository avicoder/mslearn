####  1. Select one of the following options that best describes why Planning Optimization will run faster than built-in master planning.


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Planning Optimization has several functional enhancements that make it faster than built-in master planning.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The database is simplified to run faster at night.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Planning Optimization Add-in is run in memory outside the regular system, so it runs much faster.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Planning Optimization allows for auto-firming of planned orders.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. If an item's on-hand inventory shows a total of minus 15, what will Planning Optimization do?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Treat it as zero on-hand.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Planning Optimization assumes it is oversold and must therefore consider it when creating a planned order.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Planning Optimization will calculate the order quantity based on the item model group setting for physical inventory.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Planning Optimization will calculate the order quantity based on the item model group setting for financial inventory.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. When a planned order is approved, what will Planning Optimization do?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an actual order at that time so that it appears on the Production order, Purchase order, or Transfer order list.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Regenerate the same order the next time Planning Optimization is run based on transactions that occur.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The planned order will not be affected the next time Planning Optimization is run.
