####  1. You need to grant administrator access for an Azure subscription to someone else in your organization. That person needs to be able to manage Azure resources that were created under that subscription. The person also needs access to the billing information for that subscription. What role should you grant them?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Assign the User Access Administrator role at the subscription scope.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Assign the Billing Administrator role at the management group scope.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Assign the Owner role at the subscription scope.

<br />

####  2. What's the main difference between Azure roles and Azure AD roles?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Azure roles apply to Azure resources. Azure AD roles apply to Azure AD resources such as users, groups, and domains.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can assign Azure roles at the root level.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Azure AD roles are used to manage access to Azure resources. Azure roles are used to view and manage Azure resources.
