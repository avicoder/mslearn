####  1. Your organization needs to ensure that no transactional SQL database data is ever lost. All SQL database data must always be available and readable in a separate region for redundancy and to comply with standards. How should you architect this sort of resilience?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use Azure SQL Database and use Active Geo-replication to replicate to another region.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use SQL Server virtual machines and use Azure Site Recovery to recover them to another region.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use SQL Server virtual machines and use Azure Backup to back data up to another region.

####  2. What are benefits of moving your data workloads to Azure Cosmos DB now that your online store is moving to multiple regions?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You will be able to perform row-level security, with low latency on your data in another region.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You will be able to have up to 500 databases, with low latency access in another region.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You will be able to have read access to your data, with low latency in another region.
