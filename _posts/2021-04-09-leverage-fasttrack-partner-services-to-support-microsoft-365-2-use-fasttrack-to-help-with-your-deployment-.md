####  1. As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, you're planning the company's migration to Microsoft 365. To help you with this process, you're considering using Microsoft's FastTrack service. You know that with FastTrack, Microsoft will provide Fabrikam with personalized assistance. However, you're not sure how long the service will be available. How long is FastTrack available to a customer?
