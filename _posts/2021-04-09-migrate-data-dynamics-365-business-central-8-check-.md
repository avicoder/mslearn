####  1. You have exported your customer and vendor data from your current system to Excel. You now want to migrate the customer and vendor data to Business Central, using Excel. What is the best way to accomplish this?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can use the assisted setup and then run the Migrate Business Data wizard. If you choose the option Import from Excel, you can download an Excel template in which you can enter the required data, and next, import back into Business Central.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Business Central includes Extensions. You can select the extension Configuration Packages and then you can export to Excel and set up your data there. Then, you can import the data from Excel again. The package consists of 27 tables, including master data such as customers, vendors, items, and accounts, other basic setup tables such as shipping methods, and transactions tables such as sales header and lines.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Using the search function, you can open the Data Migration page. There you can enter a new line for table 18 â€“ the Customer table. After selecting the fields to include in the Excel template, you can export to Excel, enter the required information and import back into Business Central. Afterwards, you can do the same for the vendor table.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the data migration page, that you can find via the search functionality, you can run the Configuration wizard that imports the customer and vendor data to Business Central from Excel.
