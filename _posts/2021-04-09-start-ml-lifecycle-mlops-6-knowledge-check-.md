####  1. What is a benefit of a machine learning pipeline?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Machine learning pipelines create a dependent workflow process to ensure each stage of a workflow is tested and completed before moving on to the next stage.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Machine learning pipelines serve as an audit trail for a modelâ€™s history and make it possible to automatically trigger workflows after certain events.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Machine learning pipelines require data scientists to begin their work from the beginning to make changes, which improves their accuracy and performance.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Having independent steps saved to a pipeline allows multiple data scientists to work on the same pipeline concurrently.

####  2. What is the recommended approach for monitoring machine learning models?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Machine learning models should be monitored by automatic analysis with established performance thresholds that trigger alerts.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Machine learning models should be monitored by manual spot check analysis with someone testing the model and applying their own analysis.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A combination of automatic monitoring and manual spot checks.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Machine learning models should be monitored by continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

####  3. What is a model registry?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A central place to save every version of every model.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A method of testing and validating model performance.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A shared environment where individuals can work on models at the same time.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A requirement for deploying ML models on the cloud.
