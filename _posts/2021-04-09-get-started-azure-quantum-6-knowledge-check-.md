####  1. Azure Quantum offers quantum computing solutions and optimization solutions. What is the difference between them?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Quantum computing is only for simulating quantum systems like molecules. Optimization uses quantum computers to solve optimization problems.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can use quantum computing to run quantum algorithms in quantum hardware, and you can use optimization to solve optimization problems by using classical hardware.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You use quantum computing to run quantum algorithms in quantum hardware, and then you use optimization to run those algorithms more efficiently.

####  2. Which of the following statements about Azure Quantum is false?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Simulators, quantum computers, and optimization solvers are examples of targets of Azure Quantum.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Each job has an ID that must be unique within the workspace.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can submit jobs without an Azure storage account, but having one is recommended for keeping your results.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Which of the following statements about quantum-inspired optimization in Azure Quantum is true?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Emulating quantum effects on classical computers has led to the development of new types of quantum solutions that run on classical hardware, also called quantum-inspired algorithms.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Azure Quantum offers only quantum-inspired optimization solutions. For classical optimization, you should look into other Azure products.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Quantum-inspired optimization solutions in Azure Quantum are useful for machine learning.
