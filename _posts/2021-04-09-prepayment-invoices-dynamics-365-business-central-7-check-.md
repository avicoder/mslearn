####  1. What status is used when an order has one or more lines with a prepayment amount and a prepayment invoice has not been posted?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Open

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pending Prepayment

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Prepayment Awaiting

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pending Approval
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. One of your vendors requires you to prepay 40 percent when you are ordering items from their SUMMER range. This item range contains 20 different items. How do you set up this prepayment in Business Central?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an Item Discount Group to which you assign the 20 items. Then, on the Prepayment Percentages page, combine the vendor with the item discount group and enter 40 in the Prepayment \% field.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an Item Prepayment Group to which you assign the 20 items. Then, on the Prepayment Percentages page, combine the vendor with the item prepayment group and enter 40 in the Prepayment \% field.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an Inventory Posting Group to which you assign the 20 items. Then, on the Prepayment Percentages page, combine the vendor with the Inventory Posting group and enter 40 in the Prepayment \% field.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the Prepayment Percentages page, enter individual lines for all 20 items sold by the vendor, combined with the vendor, and then enter 40 in the Prepayment \% field.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Which option can you use to make sure that you cannot ship or invoice orders to customers with unpaid prepayment amounts?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Check Prepmt. when Posting in the Purchases & Payables Setup

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Payment Tolerance Warning in the General Ledger Setup

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Check Prepmt. when Posting in the Sales & Receivables Setup
