####  1. An expert suggests using a pool of training data that has been gathered from observations of human workers performing tasks and making decisions. What is an unintended consequence that must be anticipated?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;AI cannot learn the subtleties of human opinion; therefore, AI will make decisions purely based on data criteria.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The transparent nature of AI will result in decreased intelligibility concerning performance-based decision making.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;AI has no level of accountability; thus, poor qualitative decisions can occur without any sense of recourse.
