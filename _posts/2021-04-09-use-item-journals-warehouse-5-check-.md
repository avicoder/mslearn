####  1. A user in the warehouse informs you that a warehouse item journal line with a negative quantity of -2 for item LS-150, on bin W-01-0015, has been registered. However, on the item card, the Quantity On Hand field still displays the same quantity as before. What is most likely the reason?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The user had to register the negative adjustment from the Warehouse Reclassification Journals.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The user must run the Post to Inventory function from the Warehouse Register page.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The bookkeeper must run the Calculate Warehouse Adjustment function on the Item Journal page to remove the item from inventory by posting the item journal.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The user had to enter the negative adjustment directly in the Item Journal and not the Warehouse Item Journal.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You just registered a movement from the Warehouse Reclassification Journals for item LS-150 from bin W-01-0001 to bin W-02-0001. What would be the next step in Business Central to complete the movement process?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing. Registering the Warehouse Reclassification Journal completes the movement process.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the Item Journal, run the Calculate Warehouse Adjustment function, and then post the Item Journal.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Registering the Warehouse Reclassification Journals creates a warehouse movement document that the person can use to physically move the items. When the warehouse movement document is registered, the movement process is finished.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the item reclassification journals, run the Calculate Warehouse Adjustment function, and then post the journal.
