####  1. What is the advantage of an internal put-away over a warehouse movement to move finished items from the from-production bin to the warehouse?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The internal put-away is automatically created when you post the production output, while you must create a warehouse movement manually.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can immediately register an internal put-away, while with a warehouse movement, you first must create a movement worksheet line that is based on when the warehouse movement was created.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;With an internal put-away, you can process multiple items at once, while a warehouse movement can only handle one item at a time.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When you create a warehouse put-away from an internal put-away, the program uses a put-away template to find the best bin for the item, while with a warehouse movement, the user must enter the warehouse bin manually.

####  2. You can retrieve released production orders in the pick worksheet and then create a warehouse pick to pick the production components. What is another way to create a warehouse pick for a released production order?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From the production journal, run the Create Pick function.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From Released Production Orders, run the Create Pick function.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an internal pick for the released production order. On the internal pick, run the Create Pick function.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the consumption journal, run the Create Pick function.
