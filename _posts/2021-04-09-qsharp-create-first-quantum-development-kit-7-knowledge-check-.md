####  1. Which of these statements is true about the random number generator that you built in this module?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You always get truly random numbers, both in the simulator and on quantum hardware.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You never get truly random numbers. You get only pseudorandom numbers.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;In the simulator, you get pseudorandom numbers. On a quantum computer, you get truly random numbers.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You need to run a quantum computation multiple times and then compute the average of all results. The easiest way to do that is to:


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Run the quantum program multiple times and then route the results to a second program, which computes the average.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Combine classical and quantum operations in the same program.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Write the quantum computation and the averaging computation all as quantum operations.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. You're ready to run your algorithm on Azure Quantum. What's the best way to choose which hardware runs your code most efficiently?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Run a more limited version of your program on each hardware type and then choose the one that completes most quickly.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Combine the simulator with the resource estimator to understand the resources that your code would require.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;There isn't a need to choose. All quantum hardware uses resources in the exact same way.
