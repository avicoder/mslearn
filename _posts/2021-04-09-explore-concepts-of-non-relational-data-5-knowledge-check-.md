####  1. Which of the following services should you use to implement a non-relational database?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Azure Cosmos DB

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Azure SQL Database

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Gremlin API
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Which of the following is a characteristic of non-relational databases?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Non-relational databases contain tables with flat fixed-column records

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Non-relational databases require you to use data normalization techniques to reduce data duplication

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Non-relational databases are either schema free or have relaxed schemas

####  3. You are building a system that monitors the temperature throughout a set of office blocks, and sets the air conditioning in each room in each block to maintain a pleasant ambient temperature. Your system has to manage the air conditioning in several thousand buildings spread across the country or region, and each building typically contains at least 100 air-conditioned rooms. What type of NoSQL data store is most appropriate for capturing the temperature data to enable it to be processed quickly?
