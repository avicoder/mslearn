####  1. What is the correct hierarchy of priorities that the program uses to determine which location must appear on a sales order?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Customer Card, User Setup, Responsibility Center

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;User Setup, Customer Card, Company Information

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Customer Card, Responsibility Center, Company Information

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibility Center, Customer Card, Company Information
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. CRONUS has two locations, EAST and WEST. Each location manages its own item purchases. What is the best way to set up this parameter in Business Central?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Assign location EAST to each vendor, and then set up a responsibility center for location WEST and assign it to the users that order items for location WEST.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Set up responsibility centers for EAST and WEST, and then assign them to users based on the location that they order items for. Leave the location code on the vendor cards blank.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Have users manually select the location on purchase orders.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;For each vendor, set up two order addresses to which you assign locations EAST and WEST.
