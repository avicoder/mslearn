####  2. An online art creation and distribution website allows users to upload artwork and share it with other users. Other users can comment on and, if the uploader allows, remix the artwork submitted by the original artist. The website has become popular and is now evaluating storage options that can scale as the website continually increases in popularity. Given the needs of the website, what type of database would be the best fit to store the users' artwork?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Graph database

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Relational database

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Document store

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Key-value store

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Columnar database
