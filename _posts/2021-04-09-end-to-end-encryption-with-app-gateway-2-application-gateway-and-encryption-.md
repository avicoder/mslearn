####  1. What are the benefits of using Application Gateway to help protect traffic sent to or from your applications?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Application Gateway can implement an SSL connection with clients. There's no need to encrypt data sent from the gateway to the servers running your application.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Application Gateway can implement an SSL connection with clients. Application Gateway can also implement an SSL connection with the servers running your application.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Application Gateway doesn't require an SSL connection with clients. All encryption is carried out by the connection with the servers running your application.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Application Gateway automatically protects the communications between clients and the servers running your application. You don't need to do any additional configuration.
