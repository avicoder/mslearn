####  1. Which of the following statements about merges is false?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Files added on the compare branch can be merged into the base branch if they don't yet exist there.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Edits to lines of code on the compare branch can be merged if those same lines haven't changed on the base branch since the compare branch was last pulled.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When a merge completes successfully, it ensures that your changes didn't break the build.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Why are merge conflicts bad?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The base branch becomes unstable until the conflicts are resolved. As a result, associated builds probably won't succeed.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;This is a trick question. Merge conflicts aren't bad; they're an inevitable part of distributed version control.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Merge conflicts are embarrassing for the offending developer because everyone will think they were careless.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. What is the best way to avoid most complex merge conflicts?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Regularly pull updates your branch.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only pull updates for the base branch onto your branch immediately before creating a pull request.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Open a pull request as soon as you create your branch. This transparency will help everyone else understand your proposed changes so they don't merge any competing code before you do.
