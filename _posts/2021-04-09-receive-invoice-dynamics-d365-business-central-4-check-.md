####  1. You have ordered 12 units of item 1900-S (Paris Guest Chair). You receive four chairs, and the vendor already invoiced all 12. How should you process the purchase order?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;In the Qty. to Receive field, enter 4. In the Qty. to Invoice field, enter 12. Next, select Post and then select Receive and Invoice.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not possible to invoice more items than you have received. Therefore, you should wait to post the invoice for the 12 chairs until you have received the remaining eight.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot invoice more units than you have received at the same time. Therefore, you should post the receipt of the four chairs and then post the invoice for all 12.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot invoice more units than you have received at the same time. Therefore, you must receive and invoice all 12 chairs. Then, you can use the Undo Receipt function on the posted purchase receipt to undo the receipt of eight chairs.
