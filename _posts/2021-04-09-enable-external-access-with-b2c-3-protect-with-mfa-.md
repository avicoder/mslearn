####  1. Some patients are hard of hearing. You've been asked to ensure that multi-factor authentication takes these patients into account. How can you meet this requirement with minimal effort?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Configure multi-factor authentication in your application code. Code the app so that users can choose to receive text messages instead of phone calls.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Configure multi-factor authentication in your user flow. Users can then choose to receive a text message instead of a phone call.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Configure multi-factor authentication in your page-layout template. Users can choose to receive a text message instead of a phone call.

####  2. You need to disable multi-factor authentication temporarily for your healthcare application. How can you do that?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Delete the user flow and create a new one to disable multi-factor authentication.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pause the user flow and disable multi-factor authentication. Then, resume the user flow.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Go back to your user flow and disable multi-factor authentication by using the toggle.
