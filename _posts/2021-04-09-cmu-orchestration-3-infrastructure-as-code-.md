####  1. Which of the following statements best describes the primary purpose of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The principal objective of IaC is to simplify the process of deploying cloud resources to two or more cloud environments.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The principal objective of IaC is to ensure the high availability of virtual machines and other cloud resources.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The principal objective of IaC is to define a process for achieving an outcome (for example, the process for provisioning a set of cloud resources) without having to define the outcome itself.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The principal objective of IaC is to make the composition of a solution deployed to the cloud both explicitly definable and dynamic like a program.

####  2. Which of the following actions might a cloud administrator perform with an IaC/CM tool?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use XML or another declarative language to define the resources that comprise a cloud solution, and then use an IaC/CM tool to deploy the solution to a cloud data center.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Revise an XML document that defines a cloud solution to include new cloud resources, and then use an IaC/CM tool to update the solution in a cloud data center.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Revise an XML document that defines a cloud solution to remove some resources and modify others, and then use an IaC/CM tool to update the solution in a cloud data center.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;All of the above.
