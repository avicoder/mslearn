####  1. Your sales team is in desperate need of a mobile application that can display rows living in a SharePoint list. When displaying the records, multiple pieces of information about each record need to be visible to the user. Which of the following Power Apps tools would you use when designing your app to achieve this functionality?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a gallery to display the sales rows.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a form to display the sales rows.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an input control to display the sales rows.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You have been tasked with creating a Power App that can scan barcodes that will display the scanned item's information on the screen. Out of the following control options, which one would the barcode scanner fall under?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Galleries

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Media

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Forms
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. You have a gallery control in your app for displaying all customer orders. Your manager says she would like to see orders from the last 90 days in addition. How would you reduce the amount of data she sees?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You would modify the data source to purge out all orders older than 90 days.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the data filtering wizard.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a formula for your gallery that uses the Filter function.
