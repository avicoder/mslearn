####  1. You need to create and assign a data type to a variable. The variable should only have access to a defined list of values “Invent,” “Sale,” and “Purchase.” Which data type should you use?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The string data type should be used.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The enum data type should be used.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The integer data type should be used.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The container composite data type should be used.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You need a conditional statement that checks if a variable equals “In progress,” “Completed,” or “Canceled.” Different code needs to run, depending on what the variable equals. A default block of code needs to run if the variable does not equal any of the values. What conditional statement is most appropriate?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Error handling

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A ternary operation

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;If statement

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Switch statement
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. An error is sometimes thrown in a certain try…catch block. You know that the issue can be fixed within the code during the error handling code block. What statement could you use when the error is found to run the code again?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The throw statement should be used in the catch statement to rerun the try block.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The finally statement should be used in the catch statement to rerun the try block.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The retry statement could be used in the catch statement to rerun the try block.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A business system function should be used in the catch statement to rerun the try block.
