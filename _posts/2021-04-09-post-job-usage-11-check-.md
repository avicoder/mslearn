####  1. You purchased items for a job and they are received in the warehouse. However, the project manager can't find them in the list of job ledger entries for that job. Why?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Business Central only creates job ledger entries when you invoice a purchase order.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can only post items to a job from a purchase invoice, not from a purchase order.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You must first run the Get Receipt Lines function for the job.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can only post items to a job from a job journal, not from a purchase document.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. From where can you enter item tracking information for an item and then post it to a job?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From a purchase line, a job journal line, and a job journal G/L line

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From a purchase line and a job journal line

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only from a purchase line

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only from a job journal line and a job G/L journal line
