####  3. When you opened one of your offices in the United States, the office was located in an un-incorporated portion of the county and thus, addressed off the county’s addressing scheme. Now the local city has annexed the property your office is on and changed the address to match the city’s address scheme. You need to change Emergency Address for your office. Which of the following best describes what you need to do to change the Emergency Address?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Go into the Microsoft Teams admin center and edit the Emergency Address.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You must enter the new address and revalidate.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because the geo code (latitude and longitude) has not changed, there is no action required on your part. The Emergency Routing Service Providers has updated the system.
