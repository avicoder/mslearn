####  1. What level of reliability should we strive for in our services, systems and products?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;100\%

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;as much as we can afford

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;an appropriate level
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. If our monitoring systems detect that half of the servers powering one of our services go down, how severe of a problem is this?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;severe - we need to scramble all of our team to get the servers operational again

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;medium - we should begin work as soon as possible to get them operational again

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;low - we can deal with those servers whenever time permits

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;it depends
