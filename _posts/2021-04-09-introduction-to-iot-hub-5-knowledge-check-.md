####  1. Suppose you work for manufacturing company. You're responsible for managing the authenticity of data from different kinds of sensors. All the devices are connected to IoT Hub. In this scenario, IoT Hub is suitable because:


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;IoT Hub provides per device identity.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;IoT Hub supports many languages and platforms.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;IoT Hub enables bi-directional communication between devices and IoT Hub.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Suppose you're managing a number of IoT devices in a building. You need to manage the lifecycle of  these devices at scale. IoT Hub is suitable for this scenario because:


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;IoT Hub can integrate with third-party services.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;IoT Hub can provide message routing.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;IoT Hub can provision devices at scale.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. IoT Hub-based application performs distributed processing. Which tier of IoT Hub should you use?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Basic tier

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Standard tier

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced tier
<br />
