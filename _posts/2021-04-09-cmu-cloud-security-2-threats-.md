####  1. An organization discovers that some of the personal information it stores regarding users of an application has been divulged, not as a result of someone gaining unauthorized access to the application or its back-end data stores, but as the result of a SQL-injection vulnerability in the application itself. Does this incident qualify as a data breach?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but only if the person or organization responsible for stealing the data can be identified

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but only if applicable state and federal regulations define it as a data breach

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Which of the following statements is true?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Security threats targeting public clouds can affect only IaaS services

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Security threats targeting public clouds can affect only IaaS and PaaS services

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Security threats targeting public clouds can affect IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Security threats targeting public clouds can affect only PaaS and SaaS services
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Your organization owns a public-facing Web site that is hosted in Azure. It requires users to log in and uses trusted identity providers such as Microsoft and Google to support logins. A hacker sends a malicious e-mail to the employees of your organization containing a link to a login page that looks identical to the real login page, but in fact is designed to "spoof" unsuspecting users into revealing their user names and passwords. What type of security threat is this attack?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;SQL injection attack

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Cross-site scripting attack

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Man-in-the-middle attack

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Phishing attack
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. Some cloud service providers offer dedicated VM instances as an added security measure. Such instances are guaranteed to run on dedicated hardware, which will not be shared with other users of the cloud service. Which of the following threats does a dedicated VM instance protect against?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A zero-day vulnerability (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_attack) on the physical server that the cloud provider did not patch

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Malicious code from a competitor hosted in a neighboring VM

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Data center failure leading to your VM shutting down

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A vulnerability in your website allowing hackers to deface it
<br />
