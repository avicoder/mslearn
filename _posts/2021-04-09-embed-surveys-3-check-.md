####  1. The support manager at an organization wants to have a survey embedded on the company website to provide customers with a way to ask questions and raise issues without needing to sign in to a portal. A new survey is created and is ready to be added to the site. What are the three available options for embedding the survey?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Inline, Pop-up, and Dynamic

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Button, Inline, and Formatted

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pop-up, Button, and Inline
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. The survey maker has added a variable to a survey, which will be embedded on a product page on their website. After responses have been received, the survey maker wants to review the related variable information. Where is this information found in Dynamics 365 Customer Voice?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From the Send section on the survey and then, by selecting Embed, the variables for each response will be displayed

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From the Survey, on the Customization menu, and then in the Variables section, where the variable that is used for each response is found

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From the survey reports area, within the Respondents flyout menu, and then on the Personalized data tab for each response.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. After embedding a survey onto a webpage, the webmaster who is editing the page has found that it’s displaying in a small window and that the size of the displayed survey needs to be adjusted. How can the webmaster accomplish this task so that the survey is displayed on a larger scale?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add a style element to the “surveyDiv” to include a height and width size to determine how large the area should be.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust the custom CSS on the survey in Dynamics 365 Customer Voice to make changes to the size of the font that is used on the survey.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the Formatting settings on the survey in Dynamics 365 Customer Voice and turn off the progress bar and question numbers to change the size of the survey.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. The Customer Service manager has a Case Feedback survey that is sent to customers on closure of a support ticket. The survey uses variables for personalization to show the case number and case title that the feedback is about. The manager wants to have the survey embedded on the website and has asked a team member to complete this task. Which of the following statements is accurate about this request?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The request is reasonable. The survey can be embedded on a webpage without loss of functionality or personalization.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The request can be granted, but the Case Number and Case Title will not populate. All other functionality will remain.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The request should not be granted because the survey will become anonymous, with no way to pass through the data that is needed to populate the respondents' Name, Case Number, and Case Title.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  5. Though it’s not possible to use variables for personalization when you are embedding a survey in a website, you can use variables to store data, which then will pass back through in the survey responses. This method provides you with the ability to create triggers and then act on the received data. Which three steps should you take for the most effective flow in Power Automate?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Dynamics 365 Customer Voice connector as the trigger when a new record is created, use the Microsoft Forms connector and the Get response details action, and then use a Compose step to get the variables from the context data.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Microsoft Dataverse connector and the trigger of “a new record is created” for the Dynamics 365 Customer Voice survey response entity, use the Microsoft Forms connector and the Get response details action, and then use a Parse JSON action to extract the variables from the Context Data field.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Microsoft Dataverse connector and the trigger of “a new record is created” for the Dynamics 365 Customer Voice survey response entity, use the Dynamics 365 Customer Voice connector with the Get responses action, and then use a Parse JSON action to extract the variables from the Context Data field.
