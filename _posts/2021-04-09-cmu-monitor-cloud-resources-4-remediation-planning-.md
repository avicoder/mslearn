####  1. The primary objective of a key performance indicator (KPI) is to:


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Trigger an action such as a warning or alert when something is wrong or is about to go wrong

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Log problems and the actions taken to correct them in a persistent data store for later analysis

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Quantify the performance of a system as it relates to one of the following: health, success in meeting business objectives, user satisfaction, or speed in mitigating problems

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Determine who to blame when a system goes down
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. The basic principle of everyday remediation is to:


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure that system administrators are aware when problems occur that affect the responsiveness of a system or its ability  to serve business objectives.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure that system administrators are aware when the ratio of requests processed to requests received falls below a specified threshold, usually 50\%.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use performance metrics of various types to promptly mitigate breakages when they occur, and to identify trends in the IT department's response time.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use performance metrics of various types to continually improve a system, even when it hasn't reached a breaking point.
