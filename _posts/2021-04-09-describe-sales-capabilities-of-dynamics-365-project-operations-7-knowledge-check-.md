####  1. Which of the following sales components in Dynamics 365 Project Operations represents a project that has been sold to a customer?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Project Opportunity
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You're selling a custom software implementation project to one of your customers. The project managers need to be aware of the project and consider it as they plan staffing on other projects. Which record type would you typically create to add to the project estimate?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Project Lead

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Project Opportunity
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. You're building a project quote for a custom security solution to implement in a customer's global offices. You need to add line items for the required security camera equipment. How would you add that information to a project quote?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add a project-based line item

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add an equipment-based line item

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add a product-based line item
<br />
