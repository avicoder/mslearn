####  1. Complete this sentence: The composite SLA uptime for an application built using Azure services is calculated...


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;By adding together the individual SLAs and dividing them by the number of services.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;By considering the lowest SLA for any of the services being used.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;By multiplying together the individual SLAs for any of the services being used.

####  2. You're modifying an application architecture that uses Azure DNS to resolve host names to IP addresses. You want the new architecture to support failover to a standby region. What should you do with Azure DNS?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Make no changes to Azure DNS.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Configure Azure DNS to replicate its records to the standby region.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Replace Azure DNS with Azure Traffic Manager.
