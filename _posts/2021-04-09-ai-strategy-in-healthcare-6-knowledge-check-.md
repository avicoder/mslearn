####  2. What is a major challenge for healthcare organizations when it comes to digital information?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;There are strict regulations concerning how AI can be applied to healthcare data.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to tap into the stored data collected through continual patient monitoring.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare information is qualitative in nature, limiting its effectiveness in AI analysis.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They need to turn the mountains of data they already have into actionable insights.

####  3. What is a best practice when healthcare clinics incorporate AI-driven innovation into their operations to ensure their success and receptiveness from patients?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They need to overhaul the industry, which has been characterized by a reluctance to embrace digital transformation.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They need to incrementally invest in smaller, very tightly scoped initial projects that drive innovation value.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They need to recruit younger doctors who are more adept at working with AI and technology.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They need to invest in new patient monitoring devices that can retain the necessary information to analyze and correlate data.
