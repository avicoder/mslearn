####  1. What's the difference between device provisioning and device enrollment?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Provisioning involves retiring existing devices from end users of your organization. Enrollment means that a device will be managed without being connected to either Intune or Configuration Manager.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Provisioning is a process when your organization issues new or repurposed devices to individuals in your organization. In Intune, enrolling means that the device is connected and recognized by Intune based on a mobile device management (MDM) certificate. For Configuration Manager, you install the Configuration Manager client on a device, and then it registers with the site to be managed.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of mobile device management, provisioning involves planning enrollment, where enrollment involves delivering devices to end users.
