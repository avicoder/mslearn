####  1. You've been asked by a local manufacturing company that runs dedicated software in their warehouse to keep track of stock.
The software needs to run on machines in the warehouse, but the management team wants to access the output from the head office.
The limited bandwidth available in the warehouse caused them problems in the past when they tried to use cloud-based solutions.
You recommend that they use Azure Files. Which is the best method to sync the files with the cloud?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an Azure Files share and directly mount shares on the machines in the warehouse.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use a machine in the warehouse to host a file share, install Azure File Sync, and share a drive with the rest of the warehouse.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Install Azure File Sync on every machine in the warehouse and head office.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. The manufacturing company has a number of sensors that record time-relative data. Only the most recent data is useful. The company wants the lowest cost storage for this data.
What is the best kind of storage account for them?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;GRS

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;ZRS
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. The manufacturing company's finance department wants to control how the data is being transferred to Azure Files. They want a graphical tool to manage the process, but they don't want to use the Azure portal.
What tool do you recommend they use?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Azure Data Box

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Robocopy

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Azure Storage Explorer
<br />
