####  1. You have mailboxes in Exchange Online and in Exchange Server 2013. You've already run the Exchange Hybrid Configuration Wizard to integrate the two systems. Now you want to make sure that you can route email between cloud and on-premises mailboxes. What should you do?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing. Email routing is already set up.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a connector route email from on-premises mailboxes to Exchange Online.

<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Your organization recently merged with another organization, but your email systems remain separate. Both organizations frequently send sensitive emails, so emails must be encrypted between your email servers. Both organizations currently use Exchange Online in Microsoft 365. What should you do to encrypt mail between the servers?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Do nothing.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Run the Hybrid Configuration wizard

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Manually create connectors between the organizations
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. You created a connector to route mail from your Exchange Online subscription to on-premises Exchange 2007 servers, but test emails haven't arrived. You suspect a firewall issue. What should you check?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Port 25 is open for Exchange Online IP addresses

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Port 80 is open for Exchange Online IP addresses.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Port 53 is open for Exchange Online IP addresses
