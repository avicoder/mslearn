####  1. Your organization has Linux virtual machines on Azure, and you want to enable Azure Disk Encryption to help secure all of the OS disks. How can you achieve this?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure that the key vault and the virtual machines are in the same region. Create a backup, enable disk encryption, and then sign in to the machine to monitor it during encryption.

####  2. Your organization uses client-side encryption before storing data in Azure. What must you create first to encrypt data before it's sent to Azure?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a disk encryption key.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a key connection encryption key.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a content encryption key.

<br />

####  3. Your organization has data stored in hard drives. It wants to move this data into a secure Azure storage solution. What solution would allow you to encrypt this data with minimal effort?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Azure Disk Encryption.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Azure Storage Service Encryption.
