####  1. In Xamarin.Forms, which statement best describes elements such as Button and Entry?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Run-time visuals that are displayed to the user

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Model objects that rely on native controls for their visualization

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;UI types that derive from platform-specific control classes

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;UI types that display only a single piece of content
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. In Xamarin.Forms, how many effects can you apply to an element, such as a Button?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;None

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;One

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Unlimited
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. In Xamarin.Forms, suppose you're writing a custom effect. It's common to create a class in the shared code that derives from RoutingEffect. You can add properties to this class to pass values from the shared code to the platform effects. What is an advantage of implementing these as attached properties rather than regular C# properties?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Attached properties are easier to code than C# properties

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Attached properties are more type safe than C# properties

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Attached properties include built-in change notification

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Attached properties can be nullable, and C# properties can't.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. In Xamarin.Forms, suppose you're coding a custom effect. You write a class that derives from PlatformEffect on each platform. How is your platform effect notified when one of the properties on the Xamarin.Forms element changes?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You subscribe to the PropertyChanged event

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You override the OnElementPropertyChanged method

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You override the OnElementChanged method

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You use MessagingCenter.Subscribe to register for notifications
<br />
