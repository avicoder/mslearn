####  1. A company uses a decentralized organizational model when it comes to AI implementation. What might be a disadvantage of their decentralized model when compared to a centralized model?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They can’t utilize the cross sharing of knowledge.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Their ability to rapidly innovate is extremely inhibited.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;They lack the ability to create standards at the grassroots level.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of decentralization can constrain innovation.

####  2. Why is it important to clearly define an AI framework when adopting a responsible AI approach?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A clearly defined AI framework provides a reference point for AI systems, helping them adjust their own behavior to remain in compliance and eliminate bias.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Having a clearly defined AI framework doesn’t matter when adopting a responsible AI approach because AI systems won’t always be compliant with the framework.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A clearly defined AI framework establishes consistent guidelines across the organization, building trust in AI systems.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A clearly defined AI framework establishes consistent guidelines across the organization to ensure all teams are evaluating AI systems consistently and compliance is maintained.

####  3. You want to implement a governance approach to AI within your organization that will incorporate a diverse array of outside experts and senior leaders from within the company. What will be part of your governance approach?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;First-party AI system.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Third-party AI system.

####  4. What role do humans play in the creation and use of AI?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Humans play a role in creating the rules and policies that govern AI.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Humans play a role in the entire lifecycle of an AI model, from design and development to continuous evaluation and improvement.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Humans play a role in assessing AI performance and should run occasional quality assurance tests.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;AI systems don’t require humans, they’re designed to operate without human involvement.
