####  1. A web browser for Android and iOS platforms claims to be much more secure than its competitors. Its claim to fame is its ability to execute code natively on users' devices to deliver rich applications that run smoothly. This browser also delivers higher security because all web-based plugins (for example, JavaScript, Flash, Java applets) execute in a runtime virtualization engine built into the web browser. This web browser is an example of:

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A process virtual machine

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A hosted system virtual machine

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A dual-mode system virtual machine
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Connectix Virtual Game Station (CVGS) is a program developed by Connectix that allows PCs (typically running a 32-bit x26 processor or PowerPC architecture) to run video games designed to run on Sony PlayStation (running on a 32-bit MIPS processor). CVGS is compatible with Windows and Mac OS. What kind of application is CVGS?

<br />

####  3. VirtualBox is a popular hypervisor that allows users to run multiple OSs on a single machine. VirtualBox can run on top of Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and Solaris. What kind of hypervisor is VirtualBox?
