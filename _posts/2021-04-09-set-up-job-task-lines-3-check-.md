####  1. You have configured four job planning lines for a new job. These planning lines are 10 - Start, 20 - Construction, 30 - Closing, 40 - Total. Tasks 10, 20, and 30 have the Job Task Type field set to Posting, and task 40 has the Job Task Type field set to Total. For task 30, you set the WIP-Total field to Excluded. What is the result of your actions?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Task 30 is excluded from the WIP calculation.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to enter job planning lines for task 30.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Tasks 10, 20, and 30 are excluded from the WIP calculation.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Task 30 is excluded from the calculated total on line 40.

<br />

####  2. Can you post usage or sales to a job without task lines?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No, a job in Business Central must have at least one task line.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, job task lines are optional in Business Central.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, provided that the job has at least one planning line, you can post usage and sales to the job.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No, a job must have at least three job task lines. One line is for resources, another is for items, and the third is for G/L expenses.
