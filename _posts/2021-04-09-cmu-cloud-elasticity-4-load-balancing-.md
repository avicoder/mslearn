####  1. Consider the following scenario: you're using a load balancer with a round-robin scheduler as a front end to two web servers. One web server is a medium instance that contains 2 cores and 8 GB RAM, while the other is a large instance with 4 cores and 16 GB RAM. Which of the following scenarios is likely?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Both instances will receive an equal number of requests and the large instance will have half the utilization, in terms of percentage of CPU and memory, of the medium instance.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The large instance will receive twice as many requests as the medium instance and the large instance will have twice the utilization, in terms of percentage of CPU and memory, of the medium instance.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The large instance will receive twice as many requests as the medium instance and the large instance will have half the utilization, in terms of percentage of CPU and memory, of the medium instance.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Both instances will be equally utilized in terms of percentage of CPU and memory and the medium instance will receive twice as many requests as the large instance.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Both instances will receive an equal number of requests and the large instance will have twice the utilization, in terms of percentage of CPU and memory, of the medium instance.
