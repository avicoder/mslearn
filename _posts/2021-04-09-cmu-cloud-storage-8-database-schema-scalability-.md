####  1. Suppose you're designing a storage system for an application that extracts tables from webpages. The application plans to assign a unique identifier for each table and then store the table in the database in a raw XML-based format. What kind of system might be best suited for this type of application?

<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. An airline reservation system uses a database to keep track of passengers, airlines, and flights. The system is used to book passengers on flights and retrieve the information regarding passengers that have an existing booking on a flight. What kind of database is most likely in use to power this system?

<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. A travel application analyzes flight trends by ingesting worldwide passenger data to provide tourist trends for travel agents and international tour operators. What kind of underlying database system is this application most likely to use?
