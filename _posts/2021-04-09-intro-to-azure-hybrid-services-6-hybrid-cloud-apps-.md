####  1. Tailwind Traders has several multitiered apps that it will migrate to its hybrid cloud. The apps currently exist with the web tiers on the Tailwind Traders perimeter network and the database tier on virtual machines in the Sydney datacenter. The new application architecture will have web apps running in Azure. Which of the following technologies should Tailwind Traders use to allow communication between the web app tier in Azure and the database tier running on VMs in the Sydney datacenter?

####  2. Tailwind Traders wants to publish an application that uses Active Directory Domain Services accounts for authentication so that it's accessible to hosts on the internet. Tailwind Traders has configured Azure AD Connect to synchronize the on-premises identities that will be used with this application to Azure AD. Which of the following hybrid technologies would you use to publish this application to hosts on the internet so that they can access it with these synchronized identities?
