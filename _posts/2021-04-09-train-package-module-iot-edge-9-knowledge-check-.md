####  1. A company is deploying a machine learning models to edge devices in production. The company must deploy the model to a variety of development hardware environments. Currently, they are creating specific implementation per environment. This causes issues with dependencies. What alternate method could they use to manage dependencies?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The company could use containers.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. The workflow for deploying models in production is:


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Register the model - Prepare to deploy - Deploy the model to the compute target - Test the deployed model as a web service.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Deploy the model to the compute target - Register the model - Prepare to deploy - Test the deployed model as a web service.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. After the model is packaged in a container, which of these steps could be undertaken to optimize performance?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The model is retrained.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The model is profiled for ideal CPU and memory usage.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The model features are reengineered to optimize performance.
