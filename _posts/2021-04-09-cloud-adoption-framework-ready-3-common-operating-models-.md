####  1. Which of the following best describes the operating model at Tailwind Traders?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Decentralized operations

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Centralized operations

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enterprise operations

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Distributed operations
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. In the customer narrative, there's a controlled process for release of the solutions coming from the retail innovation team. If that process improves to allow that team to manage their own workloads in a controlled landing zone, which operating model would better describe the new arrangement?

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enterprise operations

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Distributed operations
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. The retail innovation team was entirely workload-focused before they were acquired by Tailwind Traders. Based on our limited knowledge, what operating model best describes how that team operated prior to the acquisition?
