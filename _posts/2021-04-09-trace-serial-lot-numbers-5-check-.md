####  1. What is the difference between the Trace function and the Navigate function?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Navigate function only shows the ledger entries on which serial numbers and lot numbers are used, and the Trace function only shows the documents on which serial and lot numbers are used.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Trace function only shows the posted transactions on which serial and lot numbers are used. The Navigate function also shows the non-posted transactions, like sales order lines, to which serial and lot numbers are assigned.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;From the Navigate function, you can only open the documents on which serial and lot numbers are used. This action is not possible on the Trace function.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can use the Trace function only for item tracking codes that are set up for specific tracking. The Navigate function is available for all item tracking codes.
