####  1. You want to quickly upload the data in a collection of small files held in a local folder to blob storage. This is a one-off request. You don't want to overwrite blobs that have been modified in the last two days. Which tool should you use?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;AzCopy

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;.NET Storage Client library
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You want to transfer a series of large files to blob storage. It may take several hours to upload each file, and you're concerned that if a transfer fails, it shouldn't have to restart from the beginning. Which tool is the most appropriate to do this task?

<br />

####  3. You want to move a set of blobs in Azure storage from one storage account to another. You want to organize the blobs in the destination account in different folders, according to the month in which each blob was last updated. You'll be performing this task at regular intervals. Which tool should you use?
