####  1. You need to provision an Azure resource that will be used to author a new Language Understanding application. What kind of resource should you create?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Text Analytics

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Language Understanding

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Cognitive Services
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You are authoring a Language Understanding application to support an international clock. You want users to be able to ask for the current time in a specified city, for example "What is the time in London?". What should you do?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Define a "city" entity and a "GetTime" intent with utterances that indicate the city intent.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create an intent for each city, each with an utterance that asks for the time in that city.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add the utterance "What time is it in city" to the "None" intent.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. You have published your Language Understanding application. What information does a client application developer need to get predictions from it?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The endpoint and key for the application's prediction resource

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The endpoint and key for the application's authoring resource

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Azure credentials of the user who published the Language Understanding application
<br />
<br />
