<br />
<br />

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Dismiss the recommendation all together so it doesn't show up again

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;All of the above
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. What is the highest possible Advisor Score you can receive in any of the five categories that Advisor checks?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;10, since the Advisor score is based on a scale of 1 to 10.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;20\%, since all five categories added together create a maximum best score of 100\%.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;100\%, since you can score 100\% in each of the five categories.

<br />

####  4. Which of these actions is not recommended as part of a good general workflow for how to manage your Advisor Score?

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ignore the category score impact for each recommendation since it's not really necessary.
<br />
<br />
<br />

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Alerts periodically send you a summary of all your active recommendations while Recommendation Digests only notify you when a new recommendation is available.
