####  1. The sending of temperature and humidity values is called telemetry. What value in the following list could also be considered telemetry?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Build date of the remote IoT Hub device

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sensor ID

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Heartbeat
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. What statement best describes a direct method?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Direct methods are designed for querying, and automatically synchronizing, with the real IoT Hub device

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A direct method is a function on the device that can be invoked by the back-end app

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A direct method runs on the back-end app, updating desired properties for the remote device

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A direct method runs on the device app, without any involvement of the back-end app
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Only one of the following statements is true, which one?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The name of a direct method in the device app appears as a string in the back-end app.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Device twin tags are data shared with the IoT device.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A direct method can contain zero, or one, parameter.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;To create a device twin, a single line of code is required.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. What is an IoT Hub device twin?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A device twin is a copy of the device state information, held on the device itself.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Device twins are duplicate hardware devices, in case one device malfunctions.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Device twins are JSON documents that store, in the cloud, device information.
