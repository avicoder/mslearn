####  1. Let's say you're building a video game. The build process takes two hours to run and uses 18 to 20 GB of disk space to compile the game assets. What kind of build agent might you use?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A Microsoft-hosted agent

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A self-hosted agent
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Let's say you're building an application that runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. How might you build the app for each platform you target?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a build pipeline for each platform.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Configure one pipeline to build on each platform.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Build for one platform and trust that the results run on all platforms.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. A self-hosted build agent:


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Must run on Azure.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Can run anywhere, including Azure, another cloud, or on-premises.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Must run on Linux. Use a Microsoft-hosted agent to build Windows applications.
