####  1. Suppose you want data redundancy and protection from a datacenter outage but for compliance reasons you need to keep your data in the same region. Which redundancy option should you choose?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;RA-GRS
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Suppose you want to provide the highest availability to your storage data and to protect against a region-wide outage. Which redundancy option should you choose?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;LRS

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;ZRS

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;GZRS
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Suppose you're using geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) and there's an outage in your primary region. You initiate a failover to the secondary region. How does the failover affect the data in your storage account?
