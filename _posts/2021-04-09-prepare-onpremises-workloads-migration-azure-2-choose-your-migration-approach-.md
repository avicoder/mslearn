<br />

####  2. Which set of attributes describes agentless migration?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Systems continue to run during migration, install lightweight agents on each machine being replicated, and provide dependency information between on-premises VMs.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Systems must be offline during migration, costs less than agent-based migration, and avoids overhead of keeping agents updated.
