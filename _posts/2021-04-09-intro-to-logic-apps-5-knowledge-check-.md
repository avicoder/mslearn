####  1. Suppose you work for a financial company. You're building a system to let your brokers trade financial instruments. Your system must monitor market conditions, detect changes, and execute trades. You'll need to handle a large volume of transactions and you'll need to do it quickly. The faster you can complete trades, the more of an advantage you'll have over your competitors. Which requirement of this system would be difficult for Logic Apps to satisfy?

####  2. What differentiates an action from a control action?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;An action executes a task, while a control action alters the control flow through your Logic App.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;An action is a component that executes a task in a Logic App. A control action is a component that launches your Logic App.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;An action is a component that launches your app, while control actions are switch statements.

####  3. Suppose you work for a chain of athletic clubs. You want to automate your lesson registrations and notifications. You use a proprietary in-house customer management system to store customer phone numbers and email addresses. The customer management system does have a REST API, but Logic Apps doesn't provide a connector for it. How can you use Logic Apps to automate this process?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the code view of the Logic Apps Designer to write Javascript code to interact with your proprietary system.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Logic apps aren't the correct service to use and you should investigate different solutions.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a custom connector for the customer management system and use it in your Logic App.
