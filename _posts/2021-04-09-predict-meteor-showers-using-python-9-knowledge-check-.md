####  1. How often do we see meteor showers on Earth?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only when Earth aligns with certain planets or moons.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Meteor showers originate from Mars, which has about a two-year orbit around the Sun.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Meteor showers happen every night.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Every 76 years, when the Halley comet orbits near the Sun.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Where can you find meteorites on Earth?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Antarctica

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The desert

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Your backyard

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;All of the above
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. What would the following code return? some_return_value = friends.loc[(friends['location'] == my_location) & (friends['hunger'] >= my_hunger), 'favorite_food'].tolist()


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A list of all the favorite foods of my friends who were with me and who were at least as hungry as I was.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A list of my friends, sorted from least hungry to most hungry, who were with me and had the same favorite food as me.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A list of the locations of my friends who were at least as hungry as I was and who had a favorite food.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A list of all my friends who were with me, who were at least as hungry as I was, and who had the same favorite food as me.
