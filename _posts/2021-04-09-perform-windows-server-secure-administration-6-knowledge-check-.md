####  2. An administrator creates a custom delegation using the Delegation of Control Wizard. The administrator delegates the Sales group administrative rights on computer objects in the Sales OU. Specifically, the group is granted Create selected objects in folder and Delete selected objects in folder, plus Full Control of computer objects. Later, the administrator wants to modify these delegated permissions. What must they do?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator must run the Delegation of Control Wizard again, and this time, assign Deny permissions. Deny overrides Allow permissions.

####  3. An administrator at Contoso is implementing a jump server configuration to improve security. They decide to virtualize the jump server and install the required administrative tools on that VM. What else should this administrator do?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator should also configure a PAW. They should then move the jump server VM to this PAW.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator should also configure a PAW. They should then configure MFA to connect to their jump server VM from their PAW.
