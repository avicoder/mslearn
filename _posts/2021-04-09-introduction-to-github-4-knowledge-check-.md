####  1. What is the best way to report a bug to a GitHub project?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Send an email to a project owner.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;I don't bother reporting software bugs because there's no transparency and they never get fixed anyway.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Search for the bug in the project's existing issues and create a new one if it hasn't been reported yet.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Suppose you have created a bug fix on a new branch and want it to become part of the next production build generated from the main branch. What should you do next?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Copy your branch changes and commit them directly to the main branch.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a pull request to merge your new branch into the main branch.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On second thought, maybe I won't share this fix. I'll just put it in my own private version of the source code.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. It is recommended that you create commits on a branch separate from main, and there are plenty of good reasons why. What is not a good reason?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;GitHub doesn't allow you to commit directly to the main branch.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The main branch is intended for the highest-quality code that has passed rigorous review for inclusion.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The main branch is often treated differently by a project, and committing to it can create side effects, such as builds and deployments.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. Suppose you'd like to work with a project on GitHub but you don't have write access to the project. What can you do to contribute?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Fork the project's repository to your GitHub account, clone the forked repository to your local machine, push changes to your repository, and submit a pull request to the target (upstream) repository.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Clone the project to your local machine and push updates directly to the project repository.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use git commands to make a copy of the project so that you can work locally. Submit an issue to get your changes into the target repository.
