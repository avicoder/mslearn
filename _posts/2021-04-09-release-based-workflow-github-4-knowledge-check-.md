<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You want to restrict who can push commits to it.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;git rebase
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Your project team has reached a major milestone and wants everyone to install the latest version of your app. Which option is the best way to let interested users know?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a release on GitHub.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a Git tag.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Merge the changes into master using a pull request.
