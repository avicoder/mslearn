####  1. One of your customers, for whom you are working on a job, asks if resource MARK could work on some job tasks during the weekend. You agreed with the customer to invoice 150 percent of the unit price for weekend work. How can you set up the resource price?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a new resource price for resource MARK with a work type for weekend work.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a new resource cost for resource MARK with a work type for weekend work and a cost type of \% Extra.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Set up a resource group for weekend work and then create a price for the new resource group.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the price for weekend work in the Unit Price field on the resource card.
<br />

####  2. Most of the resources in the company work 36 hours each week. What is the best way to set up the resource capacity?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the Resource Availability page, run the Set Availability function, and then use a work-hour template for 36 hours each week.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the Resource Capacity page, run the Set Capacity function, and then use a work-hour template for 36 hours each week.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a resource group with a work-hour template for 36 hours each week and then assign it to all resources that work 36 hours each week.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Set up a work-hour template for a 36-hour workweek and then enter it on the Work-Hour Template field on the resource card.
