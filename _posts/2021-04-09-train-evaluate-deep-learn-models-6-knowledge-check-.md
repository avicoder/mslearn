####  1. You are creating a deep neural network to train a classification model that predicts to which of three classes an observation belongs based on 10 numeric features. Which of the following statements is true of the network architecture?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The input layer should contain three nodes

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The network should contain three hidden layers

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The output layer should contain three nodes
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You are training a deep neural network. You configure the training process to use 50 epochs. What effect does this configuration have?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The entire training dataset is passed through the network 50 times

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The training data is split into 50 subsets, and each subset is passed through the network

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The first 50 rows of data are used to train the model, and the remaining rows are used to validate it
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. You are creating a deep neural network. You increase the Learning Rate parameter. What effect does this setting have?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;More records are included in each batch passed through the network

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Larger adjustments are made to weight values during backpropagation

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;More hidden layers are added to the network
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. You are creating a convolutional neural network. You want to reduce the size of the feature maps that are generated by a convolutional layer. What should you do?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce the size of the filter kernel used in the convolutional layer

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Increase the number of filters in the convolutional layer

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add a pooling layer after the convolutional layer
<br />
<br />
