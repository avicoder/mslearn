####  1. In disaster recovery, a failover occurs when a primary resource set becomes unreachable or unresponsive and traffic is routed to a secondary resource set that mirrors the primary. Failover time is key because you want to minimize downtime. Which of the following DR methodologies would you expect to have the greatest failover time?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Warm standby

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Hot standby

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;All three exhibit roughly equal failover times
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Key service-level objectives that organizations use to structure backup and disaster-recovery plans are Recovery Point Objective (RPO), Recovery Time Objective (RTO), and retention time. Suppose an organization decides that minimizing data loss is more important than minimizing downtime. Which service-level objective does the organization favor?
