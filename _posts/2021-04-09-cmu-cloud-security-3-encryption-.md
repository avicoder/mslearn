####  1. Alice wants Bob to send her a message, and she wants Bob to encrypt the message using public-key cryptography so that it can be securely transmitted. Which of the following actions should Alice and Bob take?

####  2. Data encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and a 256-bit encryption key can be encoded in 2256 different ways. Assuming a supercomputer can test one trillion different key combinations per second, approximately how long would it take one million such supercomputers running in parallel to decrypt an AES-256-encrypted document using brute force?
