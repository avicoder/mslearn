####  1. Who can have access to the Power Apps and Power Automate default environment?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only users that have been manually added by an environment administrator

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only users that have been manually added by a tenant administrator

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Every user within the tenant

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Every user within the tenant who has Power Apps according to the app plan
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. When modifying a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy, how can an administrator know if they are about to break an existing app?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The new Power Platform Admin portal provides an experience that will automatically detect if a pending change to a DLP policy will break existing apps.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The DLP Strategy app, found within the Center of Excellence Starter Kit, includes functionality that will detect if a pending change to a DLP policy will break existing apps.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Power Platform management connectors will automatically detect these breaking changes and notify the administrator.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to automatically detect whether a pending DLP policy change will impact existing apps.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. Within Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, what is the behavior of the default data group?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;All new connectors that are introduced to an environment are placed in the default data group.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only new custom connectors are placed within the default data group when new custom connectors are added to an environment.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only new Microsoft connectors are placed within this data group when new Microsoft connectors are added to an environment.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The default data group is only a guideline where new connectors should be placed when they are added to an environment.
