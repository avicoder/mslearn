<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Value simplicity. Perform iterative and incremental development.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Harness collaboration. Act as a quality gate.
<br />
<br />

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Automating everything

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing boundaries
