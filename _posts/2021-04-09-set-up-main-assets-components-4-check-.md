####  1. Last year, you posted the acquisition cost for a new computer server that you started to depreciate. This year, you have purchased a memory extension for the computer server. You want to link these fixed assets so that they are grouped in the FA Book Value 01 report. Which of the following options is the best way to achieve this task?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Post the acquisition cost for the memory extension to the fixed asset record that you created last year for the computer server.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a new fixed asset card for the memory extension. After posting the acquisition cost, go to the fixed asset card for the computer server and, in the ribbon, use the Main Asset Components function to link other fixed assets as components.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a new fixed asset card for the memory extension. After posting the acquisition cost, go to the fixed asset card for the memory extension and, in the ribbon, use the Assign to Main Asset function to assign the fixed asset as a component to another fixed asset.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the reclassification journal to reclassify the two fixed assets to one new fixed asset.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. Can you post to a main asset?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, if the Allow Posting to Main Asset field on the Fixed Asset Setup page is selected.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you can always post to a main asset.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;No, you can never post to a main asset.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, if the Allow Posting to Main Asset field on the Depreciation Book page is selected.
