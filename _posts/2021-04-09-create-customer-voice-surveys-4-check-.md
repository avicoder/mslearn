####  1. An organization is creating a survey to send out after a product has been purchased. They want to know if the customer is likely to recommend the product to a friend or colleague. Which of the following question types would be the best one to use in this scenario?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A Likert question

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A Net Promoter Score question

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A Choice question
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. The marketing department for an organization wants to make sure that itâ€™s clear where surveys are coming from and has requested that the company logo is clear and present on every survey. How can these tasks be achieved?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Access the settings on a survey and upload the logo there.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a question and add the logo there.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add the logo to the main survey title area.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. After a Net Promoter Score (NPS) question is answered, the customer services manager at an organization wants to know more about why customers might have given a low score. How can the survey maker find out this information but only ask the question to those individuals who responded with a 6 or below?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add another text question below the NPS question, make it hidden, then use a business rule to show or hide the question based on the answer to the NPS question.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add another text question below the NPS question, make it required, and then use a business rule to redirect the respondent to this question.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Add another text question below the NPS question, make it hidden, and then share the link to the survey with the respondents.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. The customer service manager has decided that they want to know what customers think overall of the support service that was provided. The survey maker decides to use a Ratings question. What are the three different ways that a ratings question can be displayed on a Dynamics 365 Customer Voice survey?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Smiley, Number, Thumbs Up

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Star, Smiley, Hearts

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Number, Star, Smiley
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  5. One of the most powerful features of Dynamics 365 Customer Voice is the ability to customize a survey, giving customers a truly personalized feedback experience. What can you add up to 15 of to use in the survey title, questions, email templates, and other areas within Dynamics 365 Customer Voice?
