####  1. Which report would you review to find devices that were identified as part of a detected risk?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Risky sign-in report

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Risky user report

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Risky registration report
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You want to use a risky sign-in report to find information on risky sign-ins for the past 29 days. How can you access this report?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can access and download the report from the Azure portal.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can't access the report from the portal because the data isn't retained any longer.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can't access the report from the portal, but only if you downloaded it in the first 30 days.
