####  1. During which phase of the unification process can you define any items that you do not want to have included in the Unified Customer Profile from the ingested data sources?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Map

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Match

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Merge
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You are currently walking through the process of ingesting different data sources into Customer Insights.  You want to ensure that data captured in a field called Total Cost on one of your data sources will be available to use appropriately in items like Measures.  During the transformation process, what data type should you assign to the Total Cost field to ensure that it will be tracked stored and calculated correctly?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Date/Time

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Percentage

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Currency
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. You have just completed the process of ingesting data from three different data sources into Customer Insights.  You want to view the underlining data that was ingested for each of the data sources.  Where in the Customer Insights user interface would you look to see the ingested items from the data source?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Entity

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Relationships

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Customers

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Segments

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Unify
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. When defining a matching rule, what is used to help improve match results by controlling items such as removing punctuation, or ignoring white spaces?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Precision

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Normalization

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Measures

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Relationships
<br />
<br />
<br />
