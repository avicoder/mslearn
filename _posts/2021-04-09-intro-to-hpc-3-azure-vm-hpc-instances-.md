####  1. You're trying to provision several H-series Azure VMs in the Azure portal to solve some complex financial equations. How can you resolve the errors you are receiving?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Azure Virtual Machines pricing detail page to ensure that the problem you want to solve is supported by the kind of VM you're trying to deploy.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Tell Azure that your subscription needs to support a greater number of cores than is allowed by default.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Try again at a different time.

####  2. You want to deploy an HB-series VM for a weather modeling startup. However, this type of VM doesn't appear as an option in the portal. What should you check?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Check that your subscription is allowed to deploy VMs of this type.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Try again at a different time.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Check that this VM is supported in your preferred region of deployment.
