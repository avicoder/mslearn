####  1. You have configured one item template, which is the only one that exists in the Business Central company you that are working in. What happens when you create a new item?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;When you create a new item card, a page will appear, where you can select an appropriate template.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You must create the item manually because you need to have at least two item templates before you can use them.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;If you only have one item template, you need to enter it in the Item Template Code field on the Inventory Setup page.

####  2. Some of the company’s bills of materials use bolts and screws as components. Tracking inventory values and quantities isn’t necessary; however, the bolts and screws have fixed bins in the warehouse and the warehouse employees should be able to put away and pick them. How would you set up the item cards for the bolts and screws?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because you do not need to track inventory quantities and values, you can use non-inventory items for the bolts and screws.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because you do not need to track inventory quantities and values, you can use non-inventory items for the bolts and screws. However, because you want to track them in the warehouse, you must set up stock keeping units for the locations in which you want to track them.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Because you do not need to track inventory quantities and values, you can use non-inventory items for the bolts and screws. By entering a bin in the Bin Code field on the item card, the non-inventory item can be tracked in the warehouse.
