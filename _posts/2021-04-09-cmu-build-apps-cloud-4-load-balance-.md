####  1. Consider the following scenario. You're using Azure Load Balancer with a round-robin scheduler as a front end to two web servers. One server is a medium instance with two cores and 8 GB of RAM. The other server is a large instance with four cores and 16 GB of RAM. Which of the following scenarios is likely?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Both instances will receive an equal amount of load. The large instance will have half the utilization (in terms of percentage of CPU and memory) of the medium instance.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The large instance will receive twice the load of the medium instance. The large instance will have twice the utilization (in terms of percentage of CPU and memory) of the medium instance.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The large instance will receive twice the load of the medium instance. The large instance will have half the utilization (in terms of percentage of CPU and memory) of the medium instance.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Both instances will be equally utilized (in terms of percentage of CPU and memory). The medium instance will receive twice the load of the large instance.
