####  1. You need to create a report that a power user can create to explore data. The creation of the report should only take a few minutes and needs to allow the user to create charts and dashboards. This report does not need to be printed, sent by email, or exported to a file. What reporting tool should you use?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Operational views

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Business documents

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Analytical tools and visualizations

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Financial reporting
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You are implementing Finance and Operations apps and need to grant and deny user access to certain data and menu items. What tools are available that will allow you to do this?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Role-based security

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Extensible data security framework

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Table permissions framework

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;All the above
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. What are some reasons to deploy a report from the PowerShell?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can deploy all the reports at once, and you can deploy reports in environments that are not Production and do not have Visual Studio.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason to deploy reports from PowerShell. They should always be deployed from Visual Studio.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;PowerShell can be used to deploy reports in the Production environment.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to deploy reports to Finance and Operations apps, you must use PowerShell.
