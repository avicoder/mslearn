####  1. What is the best way to identify the biases a bot may have before deployment?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A review of the literature around your bots use case.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thorough testing of the bots responses in a test environment.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Include fairness and diversity at every level of the ideation and creation process.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A systematic review of all datasets being used.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. What information should your bot collect?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;All information possible.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Only information from users that it needs to perform its job.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Age and gender information.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;As much information as possible while hiding the fact your bot is collecting information.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. How should you plan to tackle abnormal behavior and misuse of your bot?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Have systems to detect abnormal behaviors and prevent manipulation.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Design your bot so abnormal behaviors and manipulation are impossible.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You should not worry about abnormal behavior and misuse - it is expected of chatbots.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use trusted libraries and frameworks during code development.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  4. Who is responsible for your bot?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The end user.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Company leadership.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;There's no responsibility - people don't have to user your bot if they don't want to.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;The developers of bots have responsibility and are accountable for their bots.
