####  1. When you are using Assistant studio to create custom insight cards, which of the following applications would you use?


<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Power Automate

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Power Apps

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Power BI

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Power Virtual Agents
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You recently configured Email engagement in Sales Insights. One of your sales reps informs you that when they attempt to send an email to a recipient outside of their working hours, the email sends like normal. The sales rep was under the impression that the application would notify them when it is outside the client's working hours and provide potential suggestions. What should you do to help this process work?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure that the userâ€™s mailbox has been approved and enabled.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enable Bing Maps in your organization.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Configure SharePoint and OneDrive integration.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Schedule feature.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  3. What happens when you disable an insight card?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It is disabled for anyone who is not assigned a security role.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It is turned off for everyone but can be manually turned on by individual users.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;It is disabled for all security roles that have access to it.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Insight cards cannot be disabled.
