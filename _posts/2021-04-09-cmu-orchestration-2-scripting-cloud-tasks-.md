####  1. Which of the following statements regarding scripting languages such as Bash and PowerShell is NOT true?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Scripts that provision resources in multiple cloud environments (for example, Azure and AWS) are inherently more complex than scripts that target a single cloud environment.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;One of the chief limitations of scripting languages is that their operation cannot be parameterized using command-line parameters.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Provisioning cloud resources with scripts is more reliable than provisioning them manually by typing commands into a console or clicking buttons in a cloud portal.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Scripts can be written to allow cloud resources to be updated as well as provisioned, but they must be specially written to do so, and this adds complexity.

####  2. In the context of scripting, which of the following scenarios demonstrates idempotency?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Each time it's executed, a script writes a record of the resources it created to a machine log.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Each time it's executed, a script verifies that each of the resources it attempted to create was indeed created and logs any failures that occurred.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A single script, run twice, creates one virtual machine the first time it's executed and a copy of that virtual machine when it's executed again.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;A single script, run twice, creates a virtual machine the first time it's executed and uses the existing virtual machine the second time.
