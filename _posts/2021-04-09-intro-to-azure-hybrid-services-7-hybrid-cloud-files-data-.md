####  1. Tailwind Traders needs to ensure that the volumes on file servers don't run out of disk space. At present, natural activity at Tailwind Traders offices weekly adds about 500 megabytes (MB) of data to the volumes that host important company information. Historically, this has meant that IT pros must remove about 100 gigabytes (GB) of old files every few months to allow enough storage space for new files. Tailwind Traders has configured Azure File Sync for all existing file shares, and the file shares have all replicated to corresponding Azure file shares. Which of the following strategies should Tailwind Traders pursue to ensure that it won't be necessary to remove disused files and folders from file servers in the future?

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enable cloud tiering on the Azure file share.

####  2. Tailwind Traders currently provides clients with access to an important file server in the Sydney office by having them connect over a VPN. You're considering migrating those files to Azure. Which of the following solutions would allow those files to be accessible to internet-connected clients who have the appropriate credentials without requiring VPN access to the Sydney office?
