####  1. You have product catalog data in SAP HANA and sales data in SQL Server running on Linux. You want to write a report that uses data from both systems to analyze profit margins for all products but you want to minimize the amount work required for database administrators. What should you do?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Set up a data warehouse and use ETL packages in SQL Integration Services to populate it with data from SAP HANA and SQL Server. Write the report against the data warehouse.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Install PolyBase on the SQL Server and add SAP HANA as an external data source. Create external data tables that connect to the tables in SAP HANA. Write the report against the SQL Server.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;Write separate queries to obtain the data you need from SQL Server and SAP HANA. Then write custom code that integrates the two datasets into a unified report.
<br />
<br />
<br />

####  2. You have a mobile app, written in Python, that your sales team uses to record orders and view sales performance data. Recently, you have migrated the database from a Windows server to an Ubuntu Linux server. What changes does this require in your app code?


<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You must rewrite the app in a .NET Framework language, such as VB.NET or C#.

<i class='far fa-square'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You must rewrite the app to ensure that it does not call any stored procedures.

<i class='fas fa-check-square' style='color: Dodgerblue;'></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;You don't need to make any changes to the app code.
